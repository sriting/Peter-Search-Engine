Theory Seminar, Feb 10, 2006 ICS 269, Winter 2006: Theory Seminar Feb 10, 2006, in CS 253 Simultaneous Source Location on Trees Presented by Josiah Carlson Abstract: We describe the Simultaneous Source Location problem on Trees. We provide an algorithm which solves the problem in O(n2) time and space, which improves upon a previous O(n3) time and O(n2) space algorithm. We also provide an algorithm that solves a variant of this problem in O(n) time and O(depth(G)*degree(G)) space.
