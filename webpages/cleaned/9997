Stern will specifically be speaking about probability models to assess the value of evidence. He will be joined on the panel by Christophe Champod, a professor in the Institute of Police Science at the University of Lausanne in Switzerland; and Karen Kafadar, commonwealth professor and chair of statistics at the University of Virginia and a co-director of CSAFE. The National Institute of Standards and Technology established CSAFE last year with a five-year grant of up to $20 million. The center's primary goal is to build a statistically sound and scientifically solid foundation under two branches of forensics: pattern evidence (including fingerprints and bullet marks) and digital evidence (including data from cell phones and computers).
