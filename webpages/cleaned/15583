Write Lock Scope Write Lock Scope The scope of a lock is an entire resource It is not possible to specify a sub-resource lock. Why? The ability to create a sub-resource lock requires knowledge about the content type being locked. WebDAV wanted to support all content types equally, not give preferential support to a few. Due to the large number of content types, support for sub-resource locks would have added a lot of extra semantics to the protocol. Some content types wouldnï¿½t have been supported.
