Centers & Institutes Research Centers and Institutes at UC Irvine provide a mechanism and organizational structure for collective research activities that are fundamentally different from those that occur normally within the schools and departments. They are intended to foster the development of short- and long-term research programs that span disciplines and academic units, thereby making it possible for faculty members to acquire extramural resources for which they might not otherwise qualify.
