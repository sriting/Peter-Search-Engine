This sounds good.  I hope that we manage to come up with
something that is implementable and satisfies, or at least forms
a basis for, your requirements.

I agree.  At the bottom, there will be something stored in a
traditional VCS, and they all seem to use different notations for
identifying versions, including arbitrary strings defined by the
user (that is, RCS labels).

I sort of agree and disagree.  I feel that we need to define LOCK
and UNLOCK methods, but state that it's up to the server to
decide whether or not they're required before editting, or
PUTing.  This allows for a strict locking protocol for those
sites that feel it's necessary while leaving things open for
looser policy.

I agree on both points, but reserve the right to change my mind.
The protocol will certainly not specify that the server MUST
accept a new revision.  I can think of at least a dozen reasons,
all policy-based, why a server might refuse a "check-in"
operation.

I agree again.  Having the default page change whenever somebody
checks something in may or may not be a good thing, but it is,
again, a policy decision.

I've looked at the VTML paper, but can't say, right now, any more
than that.  I will certainly not accept any attempt to specify
VTML as the storage format.  The server may accept VTML as a
format for updating pages, and it may serve VTML to
versioning-aware clients, for display purposes, but how the
server stores things is private.
