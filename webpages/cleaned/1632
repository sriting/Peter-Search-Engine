Current research themes are focused on computational self-awareness principles for adaptive, resilient system design, smart IoT-enabled healthcare technology, domain-specific programmable architectures for hardware acceleration (post-quantum crypto, neural networks), and simulation platforms and architectures for neuromorphic computing. See the DRG Projects page for more information.
