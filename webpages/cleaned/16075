B35/S236 Still Lifes and Oscillators B35/S236 Still Lifes and Oscillators Many of Life's simpler still lifes and oscillators continue to work in B35/S236, but there are some surprises. Particularly useful seem to be the small period 24 and period 68 oscillators, which shoot off large sparks that could be useful in various reactions. B35/S236 -- Cellular Automata -- D.
