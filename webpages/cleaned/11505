Implications: Architectures Implications: Architectures Architectures to exploit interconnect delays pipeline interconnect delays [recall Cray-2] cycle time = max delay - min delay use interconnect delay as the minimum delay need P&R estimates early in the design Algorithms that use interconnect latencies interconnect as functional units functional unit schedules are based on a measure of spatial distances Increase local decision making multiple state transitions in a clock period storage-controlled routing re-programmable blocks in �custom layouts� Previous slide Next slide Back to first slide View graphic version
