 This function checks if the command line entered by the user is requesting help for the programs interface. This function returns false and does nothing unless the first argument on the command line is "help". If no argument follows help the following is sent to ostr. {program name} --help simple      : Get a list of simple parameters
{program name} --help all         : Get a complete list of parameters
{program name} --help defaults    : List the defaults for all parameters
{program name} --help <parameter> : Get detailed help on a parameter
{program name} --help html        : Create an html help file for this program
 Where program name is argv[0]. This list will also be shown if there are no command line arguments (i.e., argc == 1) and help_for_no_args is true. The help keywords do the following. simple Lists all parameters simple parameters (i.e., those for which GetVisiblity returns ParamVis::Simple) and their brief description known to the itf or any of its child interfaces. Parameters appear in a hierarchy identical to the hierarchy of the itf object and its child OEInterfaces. Parameters of a given OEInterface are sorted first by there order priority (e.g., the value returned by GetOrderPriority) and secondarily alphabetically. Output is sent to ostr. all Lists all non-hidden parameters parameters (i.e., those for which GetVisiblity does not return ParamVis::Hidden) and their brief description known to the itf or any of its child interfaces. Parameters appear in a hierarchy identical to the hierarchy of the itf object and its child OEInterfaces. Parameters of a given OEInterface are sorted first by there order priority (e.g., the value returned by GetOrderPriority) and secondarily alphabetically. Output is sent to ostr. default Lists the defaults of all non-hidden parameters (i.e., those for which GetVisibility does not return ParamVis::Hidden). Parameters without a default will be listed with a message indicating they have no default. Parameters appear in a hierarchy identical to the hierarchy of the itf object and its child OEInterfaces. Parameters of a given OEInterface are sorted first by there order priority (e.g., the value returned by GetOrderPriority) and secondarily alphabetically. Output is sent to ostr. <parameter> Lists the brief and detailed description of a specific parameter as well as its type, visibility, default, required flag, keyless setting and any legal or illegal ranges or values. Output is sent to ostr. -html Creates an html help file "argv[0]_help.html" for the itf object. OEChem - API Manual Version 1.3.1 Previous: 10.23.2 Category record format Up: 10.
