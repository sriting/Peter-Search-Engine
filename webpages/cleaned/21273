Software process models often represent a networked sequence of activities, objects, transformations, and events that embody strategies for accomplishing software evolution Software process models often represent a networked sequence of activities, objects, transformations, and events that embody strategies for accomplishing software evolution. Such models can be used to develop more precise and formalized descriptions of software life cycle activities. Their power emerges from their utilization of a sufficiently rich notation, syntax, or semantics, often suitable for computational processing.
