      [an error occurred while processing this directive] Publications & Technical Reports R56 | Backtracking Algorithms for Constraint Satisfaction Problems Rina Dechter (dechter@ics.uci.edu) & Daniel Frost (frost@ics.uci.edu) Abstract Over the past twenty five years many backtracking algorithms have been developed for constraint satisfaction problems. This survey describes the basic backtrack search within the search space framework and then presents a number of improvements developed in the past two decades, including look-back methods such as backjumping, constraint recording, backmarking, and look-ahead methods such as forward checking and dynamic variable ordering.
