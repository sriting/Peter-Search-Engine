Welcome to the lab for Machine Learning and Bioinformatics at <a href="http://www.ics.uci.edu" class="urlextern" title="http://www.ics.uci.edu" rel="nofollow">School of Information and Computer Sciences</a> of <a href="http://www.uci.edu" class="urlextern" title="http://www.uci.edu" rel="nofollow"> University of California, Irvine</a>!   <br/>

<br/>

Our lab studies a broad range of problems in machine learning and computational biology/bioinformatics. We are interested in both developing machine learning methods and applying these methods to study problems from biology, especially in the areas of genomics, systems biology and neural computation.
