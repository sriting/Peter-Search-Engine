Validating Adaptation Validating Adaptation Idea: Exploit additional hardware (unused gates) for additional redundancy and validation Increases system reliability without major resource cost High Level generation of Validation circuits; invariants, complements, etc. (automatic and manual) Wide range of redundancy possible, validation can be partial to multiple in time and versions Can detect and signal errors or failures => May be the only approach possible for dynamic adaptation Previous slide Next slide Back to first slide View graphic version
