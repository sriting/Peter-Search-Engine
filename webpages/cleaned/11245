It is extremely important to consult with a Bren School academic counselor prior to taking off-campus courses, and especially if you are near or in your last year prior to graduation.

For courses taken at another 2- or 4-year institution, send official transcripts to the Office of Admissions and Relations with Schools. For courses taken through UCI Extension or Access UCI, send transcripts to the Office of the Registrar.
