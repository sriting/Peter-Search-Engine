Like Peter, our beloved Anteater mascot, we’re quirky and different. We’re on a mission to create positive change in society, economies and human well-being by breaking down traditional barriers and pushing the limits in teaching, research and service. Doing so requires a different attitude, aim and set of actions. Learn more about ours below in our strategic plan.
