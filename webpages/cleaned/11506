Opportunity: Application-Adaptive Architectures Opportunity: Application-Adaptive Architectures Exploit architectural �low-hanging� fruits performance variation across applications (10-100X) performance variation across data-sets (10X) Use interconnect and data-path reconfiguration to increase performance combat performance fragility and improve fault tolerance Configurable hardware is used to improve utilization of performance critical resources instead of using configurable hardware to build additional resources design goal is to achieve peak performance across applications configurable hardware leveraged in efficient utilization of performance critical resources Previous slide Next slide Back to first slide View graphic version
