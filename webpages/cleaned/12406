      [an error occurred while processing this directive] Publications & Technical Reports R38 | Temporal Reasoning with Constraints on Fluents and Events Eddie Schwalb (eschwalb@ics.uci.edu), Kalev Kask (kkask@ics.uci.edu) & Rina Dechter (dechter@ics.uci.edu) Abstract We propose a propositional language for temporal reasoning that is computationally effective yet expressive enough to describe information about fluents, events and temporal constraints. Although the complete inference algorithm is exponential, we characterize a tractable core with limited expressibility and inferential power. Our results render a variety of constraint propagation techniques applicable for reasoning with constraints on fluents.
