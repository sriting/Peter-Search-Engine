Triangulation_2<Traits,Tds>::Locate_type Navigation: Up, Table of Contents, Bibliography, Index, Title Page CGAL::Triangulation_2<Traits,Tds>::Locate_type Definition The enum Triangulation_2<Traits,Tds>::Locate_type is defined by the Triangulation_2<Traits,Tds> class to specify which case occurs when locating a point in the triangulation. enum Locate_type { VERTEX=0 , EDGE , FACET , OUTSIDE_CONVEX_HULL , OUTSIDE_AFFINE_HULL }; The locate type is : VERTEX when the located point coincides with a vertex of the triangulation EDGE when the point is in the relative interior of an edge FACE when the point is in the interior of a facet OUTSIDE_CONVEX_HULL when the point is outside the convex hull but in the affine hull of the current triangulation OUTSIDE_AFFINE_HULL when the point is outside the affine hull of the current triangulation.
