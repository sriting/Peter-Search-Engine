Goodrich »Aditi Majumder »Gopi Meenakshisundaram »Bill Tomlinson »Shuang Zhao Focuses on the field of visual computing that deals with generating/capturing, representing, rendering and interacting with synthetic and real-world images and video. We work on end-to-end solutions from capturing of images and geometry; representing large geometric, image, and video data sets; geometry and image processing; interactive access and rendering of large visual data sets; algorithms for building large area immersive displays for the presentation of visual content; and interaction techniques in both small personal displays and in large displays for collaborative environments. Current and future research areas include, but are not limited to: Designing new cameras with advanced capabilities for capturing real-world scenes. Image processing for enhanced visual content quality Computational geometry and graph algorithms for geometry processing Interactive rendering of very large geometric data sets. Ubiquitous displays -- Reconfigurable multi-projector display systems. Interaction techniques for large area displays. Sketch based modeling and interaction for personal displays. Applications are Internet-based visualization of remotely located complex objects, volume manipulation and visualization, geographic information systems, and simplified 3-D rendering based on 2-D images.
