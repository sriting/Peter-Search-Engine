Lecture Series at the University of Michigan‚Äôs School of Information on April 10, 2013. The End of the Article Abstract: In this talk, I analyze the development of the scientific article as the coin of the realm for the transmission of knowledge. I argue that the database, over the past 200 years, has grown into a form of transmission and exploration which has been largely under-recognized. I then discuss examples of new forms of knowledge expression which both deploy databases more effectively and move from a largely logocentric model to one engaging a wider set of senses. Finally, I explore the possibilities for developing these new forms within the academy.
