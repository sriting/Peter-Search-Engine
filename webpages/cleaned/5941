For example, it can answer queries such as find Alkatras near San Fransisco. Notice that Alkatras is misspelled but the LBAK-Tree can still find useful answers. In short, the LBAK-Tree answers queries with a spatial component and a keyword component, where the keywords don't need to match exactly but approximately. Overview The LBAK-Tree is based on a hierarchical spatial index that is enhanced with inverted indexes for approximate string lookups. In our implementation we use an R*-Tree as spatial index and use the FilterTreeDoc module (part of Flamingo) to implement the inverted indexes for approximate string lookups. Our paper Supporting Location-Based Approximate-Keyword Queries describes three variants of the LBAK-Tree which differ in where they place inverted indexes in the spatial index. This module contains all their implementations: Fixed-Level (FL) Inverted indexes are placed at one level in the R*-Tree Variable-Level (VL) Inverted indexes can be placed at different levels in the R*-Tree Variable-Level Exploiting Keyword Frequencies (VLF) Inverted indexes are placed at various levels, Keyword-frequencies are exploited to improve performance Please have a look at example.cc in the lbaktree/src folder to get started!
