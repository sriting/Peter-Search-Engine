What are interfaces? What are user interfaces? 1. User interfaces help users interact with programs. 2. Users employ programs for performing their tasks. User interfaces help users interact with their tasks. A user interface should not reflect the structure of the underlying program, but the structure of the task domain and/or the task solution process. Users should not interact with the computer, but with their tasks.
