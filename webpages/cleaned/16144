 Address databases are much more complex than people think, and their end use 
determines much of the needed complexity: address matching, address lookup, 
spatial allocation, spatial analysis, thematic analysis, etc. all have special 
address related characteristics.

Keep in mind the fact that an address is only an identifier for one or more 
entities (land, structures, occupancies, events, etc.) over some range of 
time. The address has to be associated with the thing(s) or events to which it 
applies in an explicit relationship. The name is not the thing it describes, 
just like John Smith could be several people and a good bottle of beer, 10310 
102 Ave. NW, Edmonton, AB. T5J 2X6 could describe many different things 
depending on context.

Regarding the format of address fields: we have: SuiteName orSuiteNumber, 
HouseNumber, HouseNumberSuffix, (StreetName, StreetDirection, StreetType) or 
(StreetNumber, StreetNumberSuffix, StreetType), Quadrant. Beyond this there is 
handling of municipality name, post code(ZIP in the US). Then there are 
NamedLocations which are often used as surrogate addresses.

As is pointed out in the earlier posting, Soundex or some other spelling and 
format standardization is vital when using uncontrolled lists of addresses and 
attempting the match them up or link them to spatial locations.

I would suggest that you look through the proceedings of URISA Conferences, 
where some 30 years of experience in the field are covered. Some authors are: 
P. Eichleberger, W. Hurst, W. Huxhold, and myself (J. Guthrie).

Careful planning can result in flexible and powerful systems, 
oversimplification can result in frustration and disappointment.
