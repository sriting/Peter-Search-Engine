ICS 6B, Fall 2013 ICS 6B Fall 2013 Homework 4 Due: Wednesday, Oct 30 Covers Sections 2.1-2.4 Please indicate which section you are in at the top of your homework. Define the following sets: A = { x ∈ Z: x is an integer multiple of 3 } B = { x ∈ Z: x is a perfect square } C = {4, 5, 9, 10} D = {2, 4, 11, 14} E = {3, 6, 9} F = {4, 9, 16} Circle the statements that are true: D ⊆ C E ∩ F = ∅ E ∩ F ∩ D = ∅ 27 ∈ A 27 ∈ B A ∩ E = E A ⊂ E 100 ∈ B C ∩ D ⊆ F 144 ∈ A ∩ B What is the power set of {1}? Let X = {1, {1}, {1, 2}, 2}. What is |X|? Circle the statements that are true: 2 ∈ X {2} ⊆ X {2} ∈ X 1 ∈ X {1, 2} ∈ X {1, 2} ⊆ X What is the cardinality of P({1, 2, 3, 4, 5})? Draw a Venn diagram illustrating the following sets: A ∪ B (A ∩ C) ∪ B (A ∪ B) ∪ (A ∩ C) (A ∩ B) ∪ (A ∩ C) ∪ (B ∩ C) A - (B ∩ C ∩ D) (A ∩ B) ∪ (C ∩ D) A ∩ (B-C) (A - B) ∪ (A - C) ∪ (B - C) Give an example showing that subtraction is not associative: A - (B - C) ≠ (A - B) - C. Define the following sets: A = {milk, coffee} B = {bacon, ham} C = {eggs, pancakes} List the elements of AxBxC. Indicate whether the following statements are true or false: R2 ⊆ R3 Z2 ⊆ R2 If A ⊆ B, then A2 ⊆ B2 Z3 ∩ Z2 = ∅ Define the following sets: A = {1, 2, 6} B = {2, 3, 4} C = {5} D = {x ∈ Z: 1 ≤ x ≤ 6} Do A, B, and C form a partition of D? If not, which condition of a partition is not satisfied? Define the following sets: A = {x ∈ R: x < -2} B = {x ∈ R: x > 2} C = {x ∈ R: |x| < 2} Do A, B, and C form a partition of R? If not, which condition of a partition is not satisfied?
