 See LRM section 8.10 Rules and Examples The exit statement is used to terminate a while, for or infinite loop: for I in 0 to 7 loop
  if FINISH_LOOP_EARLY = '1' then
    exit;
  else
    A_BUS <= TABLE(I);
    wait for 5 ns;
  end if;
end loop; The exit statement may test a boolean condition directly using the when keyword process (A)
   variable I : integer range 0 to 4; 
begin
   Z <= "0000";
   I := 0;    
   loop
      exit when I = 4;
      if (A = I) then
         Z(I) <= '1';
      end if;
      I := I + 1;
   end loop;
end process; For an exit statement within a set of nested loops, the optional loop label may be used to indicate which level of loop is to be exited. The default (no label) is the innermost loop: L1: for I in 0 to 7 loop
  L2: for J in 0 to 7 loop
    exit L1 when QUIT_BOTH_LOOPS = '1';
    exit when QUIT_INNER_LOOP = '1';
    -- other statements 
  end loop L2;
end loop L1; Synthesis Issues The exit statement is supported by some logic synthesis tools, with certain restrictions. Whats New in '93 In VHDL-93, the exit statement may have an optional label label: exit loop_label;
