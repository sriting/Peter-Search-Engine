ICS 90: New Student Seminar ICS 90: New Student Seminar Fall 2018 Checkin Link (see Recording Attendance below) Click the Checkin link when you are told the appropriate word in class. If you cannot check in, see Hadar (PSLH 100) or Rich (BSC3 1200) right after class. The checkin class will show BS3 1200, but that works for all ICS-90 students, regardless of in which class you sit. Please enable the ability for checkin to know the location of your device: checkins without locations are suspect Instructors Rich Pattis (pattis@ics.uci.edu) Hadar Ziv (ziv@uci.edu) Course Goals and Plans The three main goals of ICS 90 are to help new students make a successful transition to UCI, to build a sense of community in ICS, and to introduce new undergrads to the school, some of the faculty, the majors we offer, and the work we do. In a typical class session, two faculty members will speak for half an hour each, about their work and background; Rich and Hadar will then also spend a half hour addressing more general issues about college life, the field of computing, and strategies for success in ICS. Student Expectations ICS 90 is a one-unit course graded Pass/Not Pass. We have designed it not to require work outside of the class meetings, but we do expect every student to attend every class. If you cannot attend a class for any reason, send an email explanation to Rich Pattis before class, as early as possible. Your subject line should include your name (last, first) and the date you cannot attend: e.g. Anteater, Peter 10-17 (for October 17th). Some absences -with documentation- are excusable; others not. It's in class where the learning happens, so you should be present. Before the first class we will send an email to all our students describing how we will record attendance electronically. For issues that come up between class meetings, we have set up a forum at piazza.com. Sign yourself up and then participate by posting questions or supplying answers. You may also have opportunities to use Piazza in class for polls and surveys. You may bring your phone, tablet, or laptop for attendance-taking and for using Piazza, but do not use it for other purposes, unless asked by the speaker. After you check in, please turn off your devices and put them away: it is impolite to the speaker, distractive to surrounding students, and you will absorb less of the lecture. Students overestimate their ability to multitask. Put away all electronic devices in class. Seating: Two Classrooms ICS 90 meets in two rooms at the same time: BS3 1200 and PSLH 100. You are officially enrolled in one lecture or the other, but ignore which room you're enrolled in and instead sit in the following room: * If your class level is FR or SO, sit in BS3 1200 (attending 6:30pm to 7:50pm). * If your class level is JR or SR, you will be directed (in an upcoming email) to sit in either BS3 1200 (some students) or PSLH 100 (most students), attending 6:30pm to 7:30pm. You should NOT try to re-register for the room you will sit in! This is your official "class level" as shown on WebReg at UCI. We will email everyone the official name/class level/room bindings at the beginning of the week school starts. Both rooms are filled, so students must sit in their assigned room. Most weeks, one faculty member will speak starting at 6:30pm and another will speak starting at 7:00pm. All students are required to be present for these talks. The last 20 minutes of each week's class will be devoted to broader information about college-level work and ICS. This material is aimed primarily at new students and is required for those whose class level is FR or SO. We will have these discussions in BS3 1200 only. Upper division students (JR and SR) are welcome to attend this last 20 minutes (the room is just a few minutes walk away), but they may also choose to skip it (we expect almost all will skip it). Recording Attendance Bring a phone, tablet, laptop, smart device to class that allows web browsing. During the lecture we will ask you to navigate to the ICS-90 Checkin page and record that you are attending class by following the Checkin link at the top of this web page. There you will see a message with instructions about how to continue. There, you will enter a special word that we will announce in class. On some days there might be multiple checkin words; to be counted as present, you are expected to checkin with all words within 15 minutes of when we announce them. It is an Academic Integrity violation to run this App and then leave class early, unless you have an emergency or have arranged permission beforehand with Rich Pattis. Likewise, you cannot check in remotely, or check in for other students. But you may allow present students to use your device to run the Checkin App. Preliminary Schedule of Faculty Speakers Date Speaker Topic 10/3 6:30-7:00: Rich and Hadar 7:00-7:50: Rich and Hadar Course Introduction and Attendance Taking Procedures (we will take attendance) Freshman/Sophomores only, in BSC3 1200.
