A rising edge on NET_DATA_VALID and three rising edges on CLK must occur for this process to cycle: READ_NET: process
begin
  wait until NET_DATA_VALID = '1';
  NET_DATA_READ <= '1';
  wait until CLK='1';
  wait until CLK='1';
  NET_BUFFER <= NET_DATA_IN;
  wait until CLK='1';
  NET_DATA_READ <= '0';
end process READ_NET; The 'event term in the following form of wait statement is in fact redundant, but is required by many synthesis tools: WAIT_PROC: process
begin
  wait until CLK'event and CLK='1';
  Q1 <= D1;
end process; The wait on form is equivalent to a sensitivity list. These processes will behave identically: process (A,B)
begin
  -- sequential statements
end process;

process
begin
  -- identical statements
  wait on A,B; 
end process; The wait statement cannot be used: In a process with a sensitivity list In a procedure called from a process with a sensitivity list. In a function In a procedure called from a function Wait for and wait are useful in behavioural models and test benches. Wait on it's own suspends a process indefinitely: STIMULUS: process
begin
    EN_1   <= '0';
    EN_2   <= '1';
  wait for 10 ns;
    EN_1   <= '1';
    EN_2   <= '0';
  wait for 10 ns;
    EN_1 <= '0';
  wait for 10 ns;
  wait; -- end of test
end process STIMULUS; Synthesis Issues Most logic synthesis tools only support a single wait until (clock edge expression) statement in a "clocked process". Some tools support a single wait on statement as an alternative to a sensitive list in a "combinational process". Wait for, unconditional wait and wait statements in procedures are not supported. Whats New in '93 In VHDL-93, a wait statement may have a label.
