Replicators: B34/S0235 Replicators: B34/S0235 This replicator repeats every four generations, on a one-dimensional 2-unit grid. No spaceships are known; finding some is probably the highest priority for research on this rule. It would also be of interest to find a way of capping a row of replicators to make high-period oscillators. The same replicator works in 15 other rules of the form B34xx/S0235. Of these, only B347/S0235 and B348/S0235 have known spaceships. Replicators -- Cellular Automata -- D. Eppstein -- UCI Inf. & Comp. Sci.
