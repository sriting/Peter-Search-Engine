Econ 11 / ICS 11 Course Policies Scott Jordan Department of Computer Science University of California, Irvine Econ 11 / ICS 11 Course Policies Participation: Attendance at all lectures and case studies is expected. You are expected to have read the assigned reading for that date before lecture. You will be called upon, by name, on a few days during the quarter, and asked one question related to that lecture. If you are present and respond to the question, you will receive credit for the Participation component of the course grade. Problem Sets: There will be five problem sets during the term. See the course outline for assignments and due dates. See the problem sets webpage for instructions on how to turn in your problem sets. No late homework will be accepted without documentation of a medical issue that inhibited timely work. Some problems on the problem set will be graded based on effort, but not on the correctness of the answer. Other problems will be graded based both on effort and on the knowledge demonstrated. It will not be announced beforehand which problems fall into which category. Graded problem sets will normally be returned one week after the due date. Solutions will be available online when the problem sets are returned. Case Studies: There will be three case studies during the term. See the case study webpage for details. Case studies will be done in groups of 3 or 4 students. Groups will be formed on Monday of the third week of the quarter. Each group will act as a Lobbyist for one case study, and as a Staffer for another case study. In addition, each student will act as a Reporter for the remaining case study. Grading Policy: Letter grades are based on the instructor's evaluation of your demonstrated performance in the course. First, a "case study plus exam score" will be calculated using the following weighting: Case study Lobbyist presentation and report (25%) Case study Staffer presentation and report (25%) Final (50%) The instructor will use his judgment to map case study plus exam score score ranges into "case study plus exam letter grades". Your course grade will be within one letter grade of the case study plus exam score grade, as follows. Second, we will add the problem sets scores, case study reporter score, and participation score as follows. Each problem set score will be normalized to a maximum of 100. The case study reporter score will be normalized to a maximum of 100. The participation score will be normalized to a maximum of 100. The lowest score amongst the problem sets, case study reporter, and participation will be dropped, resulting in a maximum possible "problem set plus case study reporter plus participation score" of 600. Your course grade will be your "case study plus exam score", increased or decreased by up to one letter grade based on your "problem set plus case study reporter plus participation score". The instructor reserves the right to override this policy in individual cases where the student has demonstrated mastery of the material on the final, but this is rare. All grades will be available through eee.uci.edu.

On problem sets, you are strongly encouraged to work in groups to discuss your approach to solving each problem, but you must work individually in progressing from that point toward the solution. You must turn in only your own work. Use of any solutions from any source other than a student's own work is considered plagiarism. On case studies, the work presented is expected to represent the participation of all members of the group. Anything that is other than the group's own work must be properly cited or it is considered plagiarism. Students agree that by taking this course all required papers are subject to submission for textual similarity review to Turnitin.com for the detection of plagiarism. All submitted papers will be included as source documents in the Turnitin.com reference database solely for the purpose of detecting plagiarism of such papers.
