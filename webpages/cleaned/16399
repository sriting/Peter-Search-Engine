David Eppstein - Publications David Eppstein - Publications Publications with Vida Dujmović Drawings of planar graphs with few slopes and segments. V. Dujmović, D. Eppstein, M. Suderman, and D. R. Wood. arXiv:math.CO/0606450. Comp. Geom. Theory & Applications 38: 194–212, 2007. We study straight-line drawings of planar graphs with few segments and few slopes. Optimal results are obtained for all trees. Tight bounds are obtained for outerplanar graphs, 2-trees, and planar 3-trees. We prove that every 3-connected plane graph on n vertices has a plane drawing with at most 5n/2 segments and at most 2n slopes. We prove that every cubic 3-connected plane graph has a plane drawing with three slopes (and three bends on the outerface). Structure of graphs with locally restricted crossings. V. Dujmović, D. Eppstein, and D. R. Wood. arXiv:1506.04380. 23rd Int. Symp. Graph Drawing, Los Angeles, California, 2015. Springer, Lecture Notes in Comp. Sci. 9411 (2015), pp. 87–98. SIAM J. Discrete Math. 31 (2): 805–824, 2017. The Graph Drawing version used the alternative title "Genus, treewidth, and local crossing number". We prove tight bounds on the treewidth of graphs embedded on low-genus surfaces with few crossings per edge, and nearly tight bounds on the number of crossings per edge for graphs with a given number of edges embedded on low-genus surfaces. (Slides — local copy of final version) Track layouts, layered path decompositions, and leveled planarity. M. J. Bannister, W. E. Devanny, and V. Dujmović, D. Eppstein, and D. R. Wood. arXiv:1506.09145. 24th Int. Symp. Graph Drawing, Athens, Greece, 2016. Springer, Lecture Notes in Comp. Sci. 9801 (2016), pp. 499–510. Algorithmica 81 (4): 1561–1583, 2019. We introduce the concept of a layered path decomposition, and show that the layered pathwidth can be used to characterize the leveled planar graphs. As a consequence we show that finding the minimum number of tracks in a track layout of a given graph is NP-complete. The GD version includes only the parts concerning track layout, and uses the title "Track Layout is Hard". Minor-closed graph classes with bounded layered pathwidth. V. Dujmović, D. Eppstein, G. Joret, P. Morin, and D. R. Wood. arXiv:1810.08314. A minor-closed graph family has a functional relation between diameter and path width (bounded local pathwidth) if and only if it excludes an apex-tree. The same graph families are also the ones with bounded layered pathwidth: a simultaneous path decomposition and layering (sequence of subsets of vertices with all edges connecting the same subset or consecutive subsets) so that the intersection of a bag and a layer has constant size.
