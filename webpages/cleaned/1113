Available below is just a sampling of the content available in the complete system. For access to the full system content, please get in touch with your local Wiley representative or sign up through WileyPLUS as they are currently the exclusive distributor of Reaction Explorer for higher-education organic chemistry courses. Organic Chemistry Tutorials Reaction Drills: Single-Step Reaction Completion Reaction Drills produce a series of (ungraded) reaction equations with one hidden component (reactant, reagent or product) and asks you to mentally "fill-in-the-blank" to test and train your skill, similar to flashcards. Synthesis Explorer: Multi-Step Synthesis Design The primary interface for solving multi-step synthesis design problems and for freely exploring different reactant and reagent combinations. Mechanism Explorer: Arrow-Pushing Mechanism Diagrams Reactions support curved-arrow mechanism diagram viewing and exploration to not only show "what" a reaction will produce, but to also explain "how" the reaction will proceed.
