| But how do you handle the C.html case?  C.html wants to grab logo.gif,
| version 1.0, but A.html is already grabbing version 2.0 (and hence version
| 2.0 is presumably already mapped into "version=best", right?)

The same way you handle the case where a product has to be built with
two different versions of the same file:  you fire the guy who engineered
the situation.  This is source mis-management.

But at this point I'm not convinced I'm not missing something.
