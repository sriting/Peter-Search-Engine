ICS 46 Spring 2018, Notes and Examples ICS 46 Spring 2018 | News | Course Reference | Schedule | Project Guide | Notes and Examples | About Alex ICS 46 Spring 2018 Notes and Examples Notes and examples, from lecture and otherwise Over the course of the quarter, I'll be providing notes and commented code examples for you, on all of the topics that we cover in the course. When we write code in lecture, you can assume that they will be turned into full-scale code examples and be posted here afterward; for other topics, I'll write up a detailed set of lecture notes. I'd like to turn these into something complete and instructive — and this process takes some time, so it's best, in general, not to expect these to be available right away, but I will generally try to have them available before the next lecture, at the latest. Note that you are not permitted to simply copy and paste this code into your own projects, but, of course, the techniques employed may also be of general use to you in your work. These examples are intended to give you clean, well-documented examples of some of the things we cover in lecture (and possibly a few things that we don't, time permitting), so that you can be free in lecture to avoid trying to take detailed notes when we're writing code together, instead concentrating on understanding the process and the bigger-picture concepts at work.

If you feel like any of your knowledge is shaky — because some particular topic didn't sink in when you took ICS 45C, or because it's been a while and you've forgotten some of the material — you'll find those notes to be a good way to get back into the swing of things.
