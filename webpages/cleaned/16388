Fekete, A. Hesterberg, I. Kostitsyna, and C. Schmidt. 27th Canadian Conference on Computational Geometry, Kingston, Ontario, Canada, 2015, pp. 101–106. arXiv:1712.09317. Int. J. Comp. Geom. & Appl. 28 (3): 197–226, 2018. We classify the polyominoes that can be folded to form the surface of a cube or polycube, in multiple different folding models that incorporate the type of fold (mountain or valley), the location of a fold (edges of the polycube only, or elsewhere such as along diagonals), and whether the folded polyomino is allowed to pass through the interior of the polycube or must stay on its surface.
