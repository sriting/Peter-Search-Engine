If the points in A are positively oriented, the positive side is the bounded interior of the sphere. Precondition: A contains d+1 points in d -space. Requirement: The value type of ForwardIterator is Point_d<R>. Next: squared_distance Navigation: Table of Contents, Bibliography, Index, Title Page The CGAL Project . Tue, December 21, 2004 .
