These future systems will further integrate communications, multimedia, and advanced processors with complex embedded and real-time software for automotive, medical, telecommunications, and many other application domains. The goal of this program is to prepare students for challenges in developing future embedded systems. These future systems will further integrate communications, multimedia, and advanced processors with complex embedded and real-time software for automotive, medical, telecommunications, and many other application domains. Furthermore, embedded systems are becoming parallel, deploying multiprocessor systems-on-a-chip and parallel application software. An in-depth knowledge of the underlying scientific and engineering principles is required to understand these advances and to productively contribute to development of such systems. This program helps students master embedded system fundamentals, advanced computer architecture and compilers, networking, security, embedded, parallel and distributed software, and computer graphics in a sequence of courses and labs. Students also complete a large embedded systems project and may choose to write a Master's thesis.
