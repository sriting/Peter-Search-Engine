Semantic Retention in AMRM machines Semantic Retention in AMRM machines Semantic retention techniques will be used to: Carry out footprint memory analysis. Direct cache configuration (e.g., Block size). Cache-line configuration. Better mapping of data to memory E.g., Mapping irregular structures for efficient access based on application access pattern - e.g., store tree nodes in DF order. Better mapping through improved parallelism/code-reordering/prefetching. Previous slide Next slide Back to first slide View graphic version
