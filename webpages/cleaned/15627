Well, there's already precedent for form URLs, for example, e.g.,

  http://host.dom/form-handler?x=a+y=b+z=c

even though the client treats any URL it receieves as 'opaque', they
can still be constructed. I see some value in just continuing this
tradition for versions.

In fact, how about making a "version" just a special kind of
query?
