Closest Pair Experiments Closest Pair Data Structures: Experimental Data These experiments compared six different closest pair methods on a variety of applications, with several different types of distance function. Cheapest insertion heuristic for TSP of uniformly distributed points in R20 Most expensive insertion heuristic for rectilinear Max-TSP Greedy matching of uniformly distributed points in R20 Greedy matching with random distance matrices Greedy maximum matching for rectilinear point sets Hierarchical clustering of uniformly distributed points in R20 Hierarchical clustering of points in a 31-dimensional fractal Multifragment heuristic for rectilinear Max-TSP Multifragment heuristic for TSP in R20 David Eppstein, Information & Computer Science, UC Irvine, .
