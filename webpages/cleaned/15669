Gennargentu, Sardinia, Italy. A wonderful scenery of peaceful rural
activities surrounds you. A dog barks happily far away, an army of animal
lawn mowers keep the immense grass field around you perfectly trimmed,
unspecified ovine smells fill the place (watch your steps!). A clearly
clumsy apprentice shepherd sits under a pear tree smiling at you and offers
some goat cheese. He says:

"Uh. Is it really SO bad? Heck, this could be the end of the civilization
as we know it. The entire proposal of path overspecification of resources
goes bust. I mean, not just for version management, but even for cgi
applications and such."
