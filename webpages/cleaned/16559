David Eppstein - Publications David Eppstein - Publications Separating geometric thickness from book thickness. D. Eppstein. arXiv:math.CO/0109195. We show that geometric thickness and book thickness are not asymptotically equivalent: for every t, there exists a graph with geometric thickness two and book thickness > t.
