The real SNV, insertion and deletion samples sum up to 16,627,775. We randomly sample equal number of simutation samples (SNV, insertion and deletion), combine with the real data, and get a dataset of 33,255,550 samples. text/html 2018-05-23T23:19:17-07:00 people http://cbcl.ics.uci.edu/doku.php/people?rev=1527142757&do=diff Alumni * Yi Li, PhD Student, graduated in 2016 (first placement of employment: Baidu Silicon Valley AI Lab * Daniel Newkirk, PhD student, graduated in 2016 * Jake Biesinger, PhD Student, graduated in 2014 (first placement of employment: Google) text/html 2018-08-15T23:25:17-07:00 publications http://cbcl.ics.uci.edu/doku.php/publications?rev=1534400717&do=diff <html> <h2>Publications</h2> &nbsp; <h3>2018</h3> <p><a class=“urlextern” href=“<https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.05373>” rel=“nofollow” title=“<https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.05373>”>DeepEM: Deep 3D ConvNets With EM For Weakly Supervised Pulmonary Nodule Detection</a><br /> Zhu W, Vang YS, Huang Y, Xie X</p> text/html 2015-05-08T15:06:51-07:00 software http://cbcl.ics.uci.edu/doku.php/software?rev=1431122811&do=diff Note: Most software published by our group is also available on github.com/uci-cbcl Hobbes Hobbes is a tool for very fast, very accurate short-read sequence alignment.
