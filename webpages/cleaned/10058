Tsudik’s paper originally appeared at the 2014 Network and Distributed System Security (NDSS) Symposium. According to the paper’s abstract, the paper proposes a new biometric based on the human body’s response to an electric square pulse signal, called pulse-response, and how it can be used to enhance security. The CACM magazine is known for its “trusted insights for computing’s leading professionals.”Every CACM issue contains two such research papers selected from top computer science conferences from the last two to three years; each selected paper undergoes an additional review process. Publication of a technical paper in the widely read CACM is highly regarded. Previous computer science faculty featured in the magazine’s Research Highlights section include Alexander Ihler’s paper “Nonparametric Belief Propagation” in October 2010 and Padhraic Smyth’s paper “Creativity Helps Influence Prediction Precision” in April 2010. Tsudik is a Chancellor’s Professor of Computer Science at UC Irvine’s Donald Bren School of Information and Computer Sciences and vice chair of graduate studies in Computer Science. He is also a Fulbright Scholar, Fulbright Specialist (twice), a fellow of ACM, a fellow of IEEE, a fellow of AAAS, and a member of Academia Europaea. From 2009 to 2015 he served as Editor-in-Chief of ACM Transactions on Information and Systems Security (TISSEC). He is also a faculty member of the Center for Embedded and Cyber-physical Systems at UC Irvine.
