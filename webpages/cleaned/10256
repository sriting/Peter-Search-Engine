Harris »Ray Klefstad »Alexandru Nicolau »Isaac D. Scherson Embedded Systems are ubiquitous and range from small devices (e.g., motion sensors or smart phones) to large systems-of-systems (e.g., airplanes or hybrid cars). The convergence of multiple trends -- including rapid miniaturization of computer electronics and advances in software development and connectivity -- enable embedded software and hardware to monitor, compute and control a wide array of physically engineered systems. Numerous examples of such products exist in the automotive, telecom, bio-medical, avionics, consumer electronics, and other industries. Embedded systems must often deliver functionality within tight constraints (e.g., real-time, power, and reliability). Additionally, safety-critical embedded systems must deliver provably correct behavior when interfacing with physical sensors and actuators that interact with the environment. Thus research in embedded systems is highly interdisciplinary in nature, requiring a tight integration of core CS principles with domain specific knowledge of the end application/environment. Researchers at the Bren School cover a broad range of embedded systems research topics, including topics such as embedded software, architectures for embedded computer systems, design automation, embedded systems methodologies, validation and verification, formal methods, and cyber-physical systems.
