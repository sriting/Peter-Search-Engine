Electronic System Test Workshop IEEE Electronic System Test Workshop ESTW 2005 ESTW Home Call for Papers Paper Submission Registration Advance Program November 10-11, Austin, TX, 2005 In conjunction with the International Test Conference The objective of the Electronic Systems Test Workshop (ESTW) is to bring together researchers in all of the fields related to the test of entire systems. The heterogeneous nature of electronic system design necessitates the integration of different research communities to address the system test problem. Currently research in each related field is performed by largely distinct research communites including digital IC test, mixed-signal test, embedded system test, hardware/software coverification, and software test. As a result, there has been little effort towards the development of a coherent science of system test. This workshop will act as a forum for the broad collaboration required to establish a research foundation for the field of system test.
