Information on i>clicker Information on the i>clicker To gauge in-class participation, I will partly rely on the i>clicker response system from the third week of class onwards. If you want to receive bonus points for your in-class participation, I recommended that you buy a new or used i>clicker or i>clicker2 remote, or rent or borrow one, and then register it using the same name and student ID as that on the UCI Registrar’s student roster. It’s OK to share an iClicker with a friend who is not enrolled in this class. Hardware Tips: Pull the plastic tab from the back of your remote before use to activate the batteries! All remotes have a 200 hour battery life, so this should last a full quarter or more. Red flashing "low battery" light means 10 hours still remaining. To change batteries (3 AAA), place a pen cap in the battery notch. More questions?
