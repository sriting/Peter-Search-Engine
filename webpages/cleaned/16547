David Eppstein - Publications David Eppstein - Publications On nearest-neighbor graphs. D. Eppstein, M. S. Paterson, and F. F. Yao. Disc. Comp. Geom. 17: 263–282, 1997. Paterson and Yao presented a paper at ICALP showing among other things that any connected nearest neighbor forest with diameter D has O(D9) vertices. This paper is the journal version; my contribution consists of improving that bound to O(D5), which is tight.
