Precondition: p , q , and r are not collinear. Point_2<Kernel> circumcenter ( Triangle_2<Kernel> t) compute the center of the circle passing through the vertices of t . Precondition: t is not degenerate. Point_3<Kernel> circumcenter ( Point_3<Kernel> p, Point_3<Kernel> q, Point_3<Kernel> r) compute the center of the circle passing through the points p , q , and r . Precondition: p , q , and r are not collinear. Point_3<Kernel> circumcenter ( Triangle_3<Kernel> t) compute the center of the circle passing through the vertices of t . Precondition: t is not degenerate. Point_3<Kernel> circumcenter ( Point_3<Kernel> p, Point_3<Kernel> q, Point_3<Kernel> r, Point_3<Kernel> s) compute the center of the sphere passing through the points p , q , r , and s . Precondition: p , q , r , and s are not coplanar. Point_3<Kernel> circumcenter ( Tetrahedron_3<Kernel> t) compute the center of the sphere passing through the vertices of t .
