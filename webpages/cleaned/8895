We had over 45 members attending the event, and many enthusiastically rushed up to talk to the panelists after the event! We had many delicious sandwiches and (amazing) ‘swag’ before the panel, and we had the fantastic opportunity of talking to the panelists one-on-one after the panel ended. Google will be working with WICS on future projects this academic year, and have been very helpful and enthusiastic about working with our active WICS chapter. Thank you to Google for hosting this event with WICS!
