Right.  I quoted "should" to indicate that it was a goo idea,
not a requirement. The cookie, in this case, is like a certificate
that lets the user know that the transaction was completed and
that the document has officially been checked out.

I would think that the cookie should only contain the most 
basic of information, such as a pair of values to validate
the check out (an ID) and a record of the cookie that was issued.
The RCS could, at its discretion, maintain a database of the
pointer into the database etc.

Certainly the document itself could carry information
along with it, in a META tag or on any tag that we can
legitimately propose. This would allow arbitrary 
authoring tools to have access to whatever information
the RCS provides -- without having to inspect any cookies
that might be associated with the document. I am including 
Notepad in my definition of arbitrary authoring tools.
For debugging purposes, I think that it will be useful
to carry info in the document.
