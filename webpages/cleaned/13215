Memory_sizer Navigation: Up, Table of Contents, Bibliography, Index, Title Page CGAL::Memory_sizer Definition The class Memory_sizer allows to measure the memory size used by the process. Both the virtual memory size and the resident size are available (the resident size does not account for swapped out memory nor for the memory which is not yet paged-in). #include <CGAL/Memory_sizer.h> Types The memory sizes are given in bytes. typedef std::size_t size_type; Creation Memory_sizer m; Default constructor. Operations size_type m.virtual_size () Returns the virtual memory size. size_type m.resident_size () Returns the resident memory size. Implementation Accessing this information requires the use of non-portable code. Currently, there is support for Linux platforms and the Microsoft and Intel compiler on Windows. If a platform is not supported, then the macro CGAL_DONT_HAVE_MEMORY_SIZER is defined by this file.
