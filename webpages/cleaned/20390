Theory Seminar, 7 Feb 2003 ICS 269, Winter 2002: Theory Seminar 7 Feb 2003: Computing Homotopic Shortest Paths in the Plane Yu Meng We address the problem of computing homotopic shortest paths in the presence of obstacles in the plane. We present two output-sensitive algorithms, for simple paths and non-simple paths. (From a SODA 2003 paper by Sergei Bespamyatnikh.)
