If your advisor has his/her own space, you may request for your account to be moved there. This may result in a higher quota. Please check with your advisor for details. If you need more space, please try using the Student Extra Space (not backed up). To access this storage, ssh into openlab.ics.uci.edu, navigate to /extra/ugrad_space, and create a folder with your username, for example: /extra/ugrad_space/peter. Please be aware that anything that you store here will not be backed up, so plan accordingly.
