      [an error occurred while processing this directive] Publications & Technical Reports R44 | Topological Parameters For Time-Space Tradeoff Rina Dechter (dechter@ics.uci.edu) & Yousri El Fattah (yousri@rsc.rockwell.com) Abstract In this paper we propose a family of algorithms combining tree-clustering with conditioning that trade space for time. Such algorithms are useful for reasoning in probabilistic and deterministic networks as well as for accomplishing optimization tasks. By analyzing the problem structure it will be possible to select from a spectrum the algorithm that best meets a given time-space specification.
