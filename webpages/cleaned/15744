Sounds good, but do we ask that the versioning system be
able to place this information in PNG files and Word
documents as well as HTML files?  It might be more
consistent to have this information available for all
media types through a browser query.

Embedding the checkout info in the document does have
the great benefit that any authoring tool (not just the
original) could be used to check it back in.
