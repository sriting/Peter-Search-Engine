Replicators: B01367/S0124 Replicators: B01367/S0124 In B01367/S0124, the following pattern replicates itself every 8 steps. The replicated copies are oriented at right angles to the original pattern, so as the pattern continues to expand it fills out a diamond pattern the corners of which move at speed c/2. With random initial conditions this rule remains formless and chaotic. Replicators -- Cellular Automata -- D. Eppstein -- UCI Inf. & Comp. Sci.
