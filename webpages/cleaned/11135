Professionals in every field benefit from an understanding of information technology, though most do not need a mastery of the technical skills of software development and computer programming. The minor in Digital Information Systems (DIS) recognizes students who take a body of these courses. With a minor in DIS, you will understand the role of digital information systems in society and will learn about the technological underpinnings of these systems and constraints on their design and use. You will be well equipped to work with computer professionals, both in organizations and personally. Is the Digital Information Systems minor for me? The Digital Information Systems minor is designed for students outside the Bren School who want to learn about information systems, computation, and digital communication without being required to learn the details of computer programming. You live in a world of digital information systems, and whatever your interests and careers, you will benefit by understanding some of the principles underlying such systems; this understanding is achievable without the programming-oriented courses that are required of first-year majors in Computer Science, Informatics, and similar disciplines. What do I take? Students who are pursuing the minor in DIS may choose from a broad range of courses: One course chosen from: ICS 10 (How Computers Work) ICS 31 (Introduction to Programming) Either of these course options will cover the basic vocabulary and concepts of information systems and computer science. ICS 31 will also introduce you to the fundamentals of software design and construction and equip you with basic programming skills. Two courses chosen from: ICS 3 (Internet Technologies and their Social Impact) ICS 4 (Human Factors for the Web) ICS 5 (Environmental Issues in Information Technology) ICS 7 (Introducing Modern Computational Tools) ICS 8 (Practical Computer Security) ICS 11 (The Internet and Public Policy) ICS 32 (Programming with Software Libraries) IN4MATX 43 (Introduction to Software Engineering) ICS 61 (Game Systems and Design) These courses introduce you to a variety of information systems, especially the Internet and the World Wide Web, which may be the largest and most interesting information systems you have been exposed to. Four courses chosen from: ICS 105 (Digital Information Systems) IN4MATX 131 (Human Computer Interaction) IN4MATX 132 (Project in Human-Computer Interaction Requirements and Evaluation) IN4MATX 143 (Information Visualization) IN4MATX 148 (Project in Ubiquitous Computing) IN4MATX 151 (Project Management) IN4MATX 161 (Social Analysis of Computerization) IN4MATX 162W (Organizational Information Systems) IN4MATX 163 (Project in the Social and Organizational Impacts of Computing) IN4MATX 171 (Introduction to Medical Informatics) IN4MATX 172 (Project in Health Informatics) These courses cover a wide range of approaches to studying digital information systems, giving you the opportunity to select courses that match your own interests and career goals. What can I do with this minor? The DIS minor will make you more valuable in any job that involves working with computer professionals or with information technology. If you will be evaluating, specifying, or purchasing computer hardware or software, the DIS minor will help you make better-informed decisions. If you complete the DIS minor, you will be able to: understand the core concepts of computer science and information systems, in particular how information is represented in a digital format; be familiar with a variety of digital information systems that are used in business, education, government, and elsewhere; know how to evaluate digital information systems, taking into consideration technical, legal, ethical, environmental, and social concerns; and be educated about the technologies and organizational practices that enable large information systems to be designed, implemented, and successfully deployed.
