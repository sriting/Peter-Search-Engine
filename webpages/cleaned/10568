CPT is not available after a student completes a degree program. Consult the International Center for CPT policies and application requirements. Students will need the approval of their advisor on the CPT application. Optional Practical Training (OPT) International students may be eligible for OPT after graduation. OPT provides the opportunity to gain employment experience in the student’s major/field of study. Consult the International Center for OPT policies and application requirements.
