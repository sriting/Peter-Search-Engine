Theory Seminar, 25 Oct 1996 ICS 269, Fall 1996: Theory Seminar 25 Oct 1996: Polynomial Time Approximation Schemes for Euclidean TSP and Other Geometric Problems Joseph Wang, ICS, UC Irvine Arora presents a polynomial time approximation scheme for Euclidean TSP in R2 that finds a (1+epsilon)-approximation tour in time nO(1/epsilon). The scheme can be extended to higher dimensions and other Euclidean problems in which the objective function is a sum of edge lengths. (From a FOCS '96 paper by Sanjeev Arora)
