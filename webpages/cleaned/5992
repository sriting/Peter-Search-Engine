 To compile the code for a module, generate the makefile with cmake and run make, as follows: cmake .
make
 For example, let's say you extracted flamingo into the folder: /home/joe/flamingo-4.0/src
 Then if you want to build the filtertree module in /home/joe/flamingo-4.0/src/filtertree do the following: cd /home/joe/flamingo-4.0/src/filtertree
cmake .
make
 Please note that for the mattree module, there is no makefile provided, only a Visual C++ project file is provided. This module has not been compiled using GCC. Back to Index
