The referenced proposal is accessible off of the working group's web page:

http://www.ics.uci.edu/~ejw/versioning/

Or it can be directly accessed at URL:

ftp://liege.ics.uci.edu/pub/ejw/www_vers.ps

This is a *rough* draft of a proposal I'm working on with Marty Cagan of
Continuus.  I welcome any comments any members of this mailing list may
have on this proposal.

>(Is this mailing list archived/hypermailed?)

The mailing list does not currently have a hypermail archive, however I
will be setting this up in the near future.
