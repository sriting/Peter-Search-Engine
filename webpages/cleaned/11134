PHYSICS 7C- 7LC Classical Physics and Classical Physics Laboratory 2. PHYSICS 7D- 7LD Classical Physics and Classical Physics Laboratory 3. Two Additional Science Electives: Students select two additional basic science courses needed to satisfy school and department requirements from two courses in General Education II, except those offered by Computer Science and Engineering, Economics, Engineering, Information and Computer Sciences, or Math. Notes Remedial courses such as Physics 2, "Introduction to Mathematical Methods for Physics", and Chemistry 1P, "Preparation for General Chemistry", will not count toward the basic science requirement for the Computer Science and Engineering (CSE) degree. Students may petition for alternate courses, and individual and group study (198, 199) will be reviewed on a case-by-case basis with the submission of an Individual Study Proposal. The material covered in the course cannot substantially repeat the material covered in the Computer Science and Engineering core courses (e.g., a computing for physics majors course from the Department of Physics and Astronomy would not be approved.) Courses should primarily focus on understanding or applying scientific principles (e.g., a writing course offered by the School of Biological Sciences whose main focus was on writing would not be approved.) Assignment Faculty and advisors are encouraged to report suspect courses to the CSE Steering Committee, as content changes and course introductions may affect the list above.
