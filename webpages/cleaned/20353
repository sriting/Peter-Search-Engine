Theory Seminar, 18 February 2000 ICS 269, Winter 2000: Theory Seminar 18 February 2000: Data ordering for visualization Dave Goggin, ICS, UC Irvine This week's talk is about a problem of visualizing document-keyword incidences by permuting rows and columns of 0-1 matrices. The permutation minimizing the length of the boundary between 0's and 1's can be represented as a pair of optimum traveling salesman paths in two Hamming spaces; one can then apply various heuristics for approximate TSP solutions.
