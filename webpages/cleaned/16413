Morin, and M. Smid. arXiv:1611.01661. Algorithmica 80 (11): 3177–3191, 2018. We provide near-linear-time algorithms for minimum and maximum spanning trees on Euclidean graphs given by multicolored point sets, where each point forms a vertex, and each bichromatic pair of points forms an edge with length equal to their Euclidean distance. Maximum plane trees in multipartite geometric graphs. A. Biniaz, P. Bose, J.-L. De Carufel, K. Crosbie, D. Eppstein, A. Maheshwari, M. Smid. 15th Algorithms and Data Structures Symp. (WADS 2017), St. John's, Newfoundland. Springer, Lecture Notes in Comp. Sci. (2017), pp. 193–204. Algorithmica 81 (4): 1512–1534, 2019. We consider problems of constructing the maximum-length plane (non-self-crossing) spanning tree on Euclidean graphs given by multicolored point sets, where each point forms a vertex, and each bichromatic pair of points forms an edge with length equal to their Euclidean distance. We show that several such problems can be efficiently approximated. Co-authors – Publications – David Eppstein – Theory Group – Inf. & Comp.
