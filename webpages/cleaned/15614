Maybe in reply to: Jim Whitehead: "Version identifier in URL" Next in thread: Kenji Takahashi: "Re: Version identifier in URL" It's OK for individual systems to have conventions about
the syntax of HTTP URLs, but it's an abstraction violation
to standardize such conventions across all HTTP servers.

In stead, the thing to standardize is the way to express
        "the resource at X is a version-specific instance
                 of the resource at Y"
and
        "the resource at X has version V"

using a syntax proposed at:

        http://www.w3.org/pub/WWW/MarkUp/Resource/Specification

with X=/foo;version=1.2
        Y=/foo
        V=1.2

we would have:

   <resource url="/foo;version=1.2">
           <link rev=version-specific url="/foo">
        <meta name=version content="1.2">
        </resource>

(Note that I've used rev, as the version-specific link type
has the generic as the source, and the specific as the target.
In our case, the link goes from specific to generic; hence the
reverse relationship.)

These semantics can be encoded using whatever syntax is
appropriate to the circumstances. But the general schema for
information about web resources is:

        link(A1, A2, rel)
                ==> "There is a link of type _rel_ from A1 to A2"

        attribute(A1, name, val)
                ==> "The _name_ attribute of A1 is _val_"
