Fanorona Fanorona If you were running Java, you'd see a nice game-playing applet instead of this screenshot. I wrote this after the fact as a demo for my class on board game programming. A standalone Macintosh application version and the source code are also available. Here's another Java Fanorona game (without computer-play features), Fanorona for GNOME, a play-by-email server, a description of the game from the Knights of the Square Table, another description of the game (in Italiano), and a web site from Madagascar (in French).
