 Read a molecule from an input oemolstream. The molecule is read from the input oemolstream in the file format currently associated with that oemolstream. This method is equivalent to the OEReadMolecule function. The return value indicates whether the read operation was successful. This (high-level) method automatically clears the molecule before reading, skips empty or invalid molecules in the input stream. By Default, it automatically calls OEFindRingAtomsAndBonds and OEAssignAromaticFlags to assign the ``in ring'' and ``aromatic'' properties of atoms and bonds as a convenience to the user. OEChem also contains low-level file I/O APIs that allow finer control over the variants of molecular file formats read and written. Access to these variants is also available via the SetFlavor functions.
