David Eppstein - Publications David Eppstein - Publications Faster circle packing with application to nonobtuse triangulation. D. Eppstein. Tech. Rep. 94-33, ICS, UCI 1994. Int. J. Comp. Geom. & Appl. 7 (5): 485–491, 1997. Speeds up a triangulation algorithm of Bern et al. ["Linear-Size Nonobtuse Triangulation of Polygons"] by finding a collection of disjoint circles which connect up the holes in a non-simple polygon. The method is to use a minimum spanning tree to find a collection of overlapping circles, then shrink them one by one to reduce the number of overlaps, using Sleator and Tarjan's dynamic tree data structure to keep track of the connectivity of the shrunken circles.
