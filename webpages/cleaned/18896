Python: module stopwatch stopwatch index c:\users\pattis\workspace\courselib\stopwatch.py Modules time Classes builtins.object Stopwatch class Stopwatch(builtins.object) Models a stopwatch, tracking wallclock time. Stopwatches can be started (run forwards and backwards), stopped, and read. Methods defined here: __init__(self, running_now=False, running_forward=True, elapsed_prior=0, last_start_time=0) Instantiate like Stopwatch() Stopwatch instance is stopped with 0 elapsed wallclock time. __str__(self) Returns a string representation for a Stopwatch, such that s2 = eval(str(s1)) copies the state of s1 at the time of the call read(self) Returns the elapsed wallclock time in seconds as a float. Works when the Stopwatch is running and when it is stopped. reset(self) Stopwatch is now stopped with 0 elapsed wallclock time. start(self) Stopwatch is now running forwards, accumulating wallclock time. start_backwards(self) Stopwatch is now running backwards, [un]accumulating wallclock time. status(self) Returns the status of the Stopwatch: a tuple (running?, forward?, elapsed) : (bool, bool, float) stop(self) Stopwatch is now stopped: not accumulating wallclock time. Data descriptors defined here: __dict__ dictionary for instance variables (if defined) __weakref__ list of weak references to the object (if defined)
