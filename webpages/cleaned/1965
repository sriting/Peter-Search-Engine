The Seal (glider 19739) The Seal (glider 19739) This pattern was discovered by N. Beluchenko, 2005. It repeats every 6 generations, translated diagonally one cell, for a total speed of c/6. Every 3 generations, the same pattern appears, flipped diagonally. The same evolutionary sequence works both in rule B3/S23 and in rule B3/S237.
