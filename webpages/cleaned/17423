Paul's Erdos Number The publication path linking me to Paul Erdos is: Paul Erdos -> Ernst Specker -> Karl Lieberherr -> Paul Dourish (The former shortest path was Erdos -> Allen R. Freedman -> Richard Ladner -> Anthony LaMarca -> Paul Dourish.) In turn, this gives me an "Einstein number" of 5 (unless there's some shortcut, but that seems unlikely). However, my Bacon number remains infinite.
