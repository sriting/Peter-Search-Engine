Database Research Group @ UCI [ Home | Research | Publications | People | Partners | Demos ] [ Courses | Software | Links | Internal | Search | Joining Our Group ] Hybrid Tree Code (main memory version) Hybrid Tree code . After downloading the file (on a SUN SPARC machine running Solaris), first do "gunzip htree.tar.gz" and then do "tar xvf htree.tar". The README file describes how to compile, run and customize the code. Please read it before compiling/running the code. For more information, please read the paper on Hybrid Tree or contact kaushik@ics.uci.edu . To understand how multipoint queries and arbitrary distance functions (e.g., arbitrary Lp metric with arbitrary weight along each dimension) are handled in the hybrid tree, please read sections 2 and 3 of the paper on query refinement . To run query refinement on top of hybrid tree, download this code. The code contains a README_relfeed file that describes how to run the code along with the hybrid tree code. Note that the refinement code would not work unless you have downloaded the hybrid tree code (from above). Among others, the hybrid tree code is being used by: Prof. Hyo Jong Lee and his students at Chonbuk National University in Korea Dave Thomas at AdInjection.com for a project in his company Dr. Progress Q. T. Mtshali for student projects data mining class at the Nova Southeastern University . Devasis Bassu at Telcordia Technologies Huang Wu at the National University of Singapore for his research work OuYang WeiMin at Anhui University, China for research Dang Tran Khanh at Johannes Kepler Universitï¿½t Linz Database Lab at University of California at Riverside for research For any problems, questions or suggestions about this page, please contact, Mario Espinoza - ( espinoza@ics.uci.edu ) rev.
