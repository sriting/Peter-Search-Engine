Understanding geometric imaging can change the way professionals approach the problem of impulsively interpreting the semantic content of individual photos or videos. Fowlkes will research data sets and algorithms to significantly improve the ability of computer vision systems to understand image content. The project involves UC Irvine students in research from a range of traditional disciplines to engage a wider audience in understanding and applying these technologies for new scientific and social purposes.
