At the moment my research work is concentrated around three main themes: (1) new operating systems: novel abstractions for structuring operating systems, microkernels, virtualization, decomposed and library kernels, application of safe languages to operating systems, security and formal verification of operating systems; (2) security and access control: object capability access control, practical least authority for virtualized environments and commodity operating systems, access control in datacenter, enterprise, and cloud networks; (3) operating system support for datacenter environments: operating systems for the whole datacenter, low-latency system stacks for fast networking and storage interfaces, novel virtualization solutions, fast inter-process communication, efficient support of non-uniform memory machines and emerging high-density non-volatile memory servers.
