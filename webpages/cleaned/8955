We pair up upperclassmen mentors with underclassmen in ICS. Our mentors provide not just tutoring, but moral support and general guidance. Many of our mentors and mentees have become good friends and stay in touch long after our program ends! Mentees benefit significantly for having experienced and relatable guidance in their first years, and our mentors can stand out to companies by working with our organization. This year, our mentorship program is using the family system, where each family consists of three mentors and six mentees. This way, mentors will be accompanied by their co-mentors during the program, and mentees are able to bond with the others in the family as well. Our interest form for becoming a mentor or mentee is NOW CLOSED. Thanks to everyone that applied, and if you did not apply, we hope that you apply for the next following school year! If you are interested in becoming a mentor or mentee please wait until applications are open for the following year! Mentorship Banquet Spring 2018 Questions or comments?
