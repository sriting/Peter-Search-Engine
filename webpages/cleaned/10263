The mode of application can be system modeling, data analysis and mining, or visualization. The focus can be on developing new computational techniques, such as parallel algorithms or new data mining ideas, or on the novel application of existing techniques to new scientific problems. A number of our faculty are focussed primarily on bio-informatics, so in addition to the links below, more information can be found about bio-informatics at UCI by checking out IBAM and IGB.
