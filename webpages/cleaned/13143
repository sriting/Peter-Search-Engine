It implements linear algebra for Euclidean ring number types RT. #include <CGAL/Linear_algebraHd.h> Is Model for the Concept LinearAlgebraTraits_d Requirements To make a ring number type RT work with this class it has to provide a division operator/ with remainder. Operations Fits all operation requirements of the concept. Next: Point_d<Kernel> Navigation: Table of Contents, Bibliography, Index, Title Page The CGAL Project . Tue, December 21, 2004 .
