Monday, September 30th, a total of 67 mentees and mentors joined WICS and started the quarter off with the introduction of new WICS officers, future events and goals for this year. Mentees got a chance to network with experienced upperclassmen, receive advice, and choose their mentor. WICS will be checking up with the paired mentors and mentees to make sure the connection will keep going for the rest of the year! « prev 1 2 3 next » (12 Photos) Share this: Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window) Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window) Click to share on Google+ (Opens in new window) Related Post navigation WICS Week 0: Meet and Greet First Project Meeting by WICS Questions or comments?
