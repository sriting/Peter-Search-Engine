AdaptableFunctor Navigation: Up, Table of Contents, Bibliography, Index, Title Page AdaptableFunctor Definition The concept AdaptableFunctor defines an adaptable functor, i.e., a functor that can be used with function object adaptors such as binders and composers. Types AdaptableFunctor::result_type return type of the functor. AdaptableFunctor::Arity defines the arity of the functor, i.e., the number of arguments it takes. The class has to be a specialization of CGAL::Arity_tag<int>, where the template parameter corresponds to the arity of the functor, e.g. CGAL::Arity_tag<2> for binary functors. Operations type0 f.operator() ( type1 a1, type2 a2, ..., typen an) const (as many arguments as defined by Arity) returns f(a1,...an). Notes Alternatively, the type Arity can be defined in a specialization of CGAL::Arity_traits<> for the functor. This is useful where existing classes cannot be changed easily, e.g. the functors from the standard library. Has Models All functors from the standard library, and all functors from the lower dimensional CGAL kernels. For all kernel functors, their arity is listed in the documentation. Some (few) of them are overloaded with operators of different arities; in this case one of these arities has been chosen as default arity. If you want to adapt the functor to a different arity, use the functor adaptor CGAL::Set_arity<F,a>.
