Nef_polyhedron_S2<Traits>::Sphere_point Navigation: Up, Table of Contents, Bibliography, Index, Title Page CGAL::Nef_polyhedron_S2<Traits>::Sphere_point Definition An object p of type Sphere_point<R> is a point on the surface of a unit sphere. Such points correspond to the nontrivial directions in space and similarly to the equivalence classes of all nontrivial vectors under normalization. Types Nef_polyhedron_S2<Traits>::Sphere_point::RT ring number type. Creation Nef_polyhedron_S2<Traits>::Sphere_point p; creates some sphere point. Nef_polyhedron_S2<Traits>::Sphere_point p ( RT x, RT y, RT z); creates a sphere point corresponding to the point of intersection of the ray starting at the origin in direction (x,y,z) and the surface of S2 . Operations Access to the coordinates is provided by the following operations. Note that the vector (x,y,z) is not normalized. RT p.x () the x -coordinate. RT p.y () the y -coordinate. RT p.z () the z -coordinate. bool p == Sphere_point q Equality. bool p != Sphere_point q Inequality. Sphere_point p.antipode () returns the antipode of p.
