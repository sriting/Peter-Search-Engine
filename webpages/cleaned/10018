That is, the hackerspace was a place where your startup could begin. The hackerspace was a place where you could develop the ideas and products that could potentially become a company and could carry you forward,” said Dourish during the radio interview. Silvia Lindtner, assistant professor at the University of Michigan’s School of Information, also joined Dourish on the radio panel to discuss research into China’s first hackerspace know as New Factory. Dourish and Lindtner talk about seeing hackerspaces like New Factory offering a potential technology for new ways of working, such as manufacturing products, in China.
