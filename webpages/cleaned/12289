Dr. Rina Dechter @ UCI [an error occurred while processing this directive] Publications & Technical Reports R148 | AND/OR Multi-Valued Decision Diagrams for Constraint Optimization Robert Mateescu, Radu Marinescu and Rina Dechter Abstract We propose a new top down search-based algorithm for compiling AND/ORMulti-Valued Decision Diagrams (AOMDDs), as representations of the optimal set of solutions for constraint optimization problems. The approach is based on AND/OR search spaces for graphical models, state-of-the-art AND/OR Branch-and-Bound search, and on decision diagrams reduction techniques. We extend earlier work on AOMDDs by considering general weighted graphs based on cost functions rather than constraints. An extensive experimental evaluation proves the efficiency of the weighted AOMDD data structure.
