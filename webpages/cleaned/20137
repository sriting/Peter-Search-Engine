Econ 11 / ICS 11 Case Studies Scott Jordan Department of Computer Science University of California, Irvine Econ 11 / ICS 11 Case Studies ==== If you are not a Lobbyist or a Staffer on a case study, then you are a Reporter ==== Each student in the group must do this individually, not as a group. Attend both days of the case study, so that you can hear both the lobbyists and the staffers. After the first day of presentations, go to the Econ 11 / ICS 11 Canvas Files, and review the reports and slides of the lobbyists. On the second day of presentations, during the last 30 minutes of class, you will be called on to ask a question to the staffers. Scott Jordan UCI • CS • Networked Systems
