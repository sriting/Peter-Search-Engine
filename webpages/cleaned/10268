Lopes »Alexandru Nicolau »Alexander Veidenbaum »Harry Xu This research area focuses on "Systems Software," the pervasive software infrastructure that makes the development and use of applications possible, and on the programming languages that are used for creating software. Among the topics being studied are programming languages, compilers, operating systems and networking software.   Research in the Programming Languages and Systems area frequently emphasizes a practical element in addition to theoretical rigor. New ideas are not just studied on paper but implemented as research prototypes, which can then be measured under realistic conditions.   Some of the specific research interests of Bren School faculty in this area include:   Program restructuring and transformation techniques for parallelization and distribution  Compilers for high-performance computing  Web 2.0+ technologies such as AJAX, JavaScript, Python and Ruby  Just-in-time compilation and optimization  Mobile code representations, distribution and optimization  Cloud computing software infrastructure  Memory management More faculty Research areas Research centers Research highlights Tweets by UCIbrenICS View Social Media Donald Bren School of Information and Computer Sciences University of California, Irvine 6210 Donald Bren Hall Irvine, CA 92697-3425 UCI Homepage UCI Directory Faculty & Staff ICS Intranet Kay Family Foundation Lab Facilities News Events Map & Directions Employment Safety Procedures Privacy Policy Apply Contact Gift © UCI Donald Bren School of Information & Computer Sciences ➤
