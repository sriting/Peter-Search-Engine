Python: module modular modular index c:\users\pattis\workspace\courselib\modular.py Classes builtins.object Modular class Modular(builtins.object) Models a modular number (value and modulus) Standard arithmetic operators are overloaded: + - * / Methods defined here: __add__(self, other) Overload addition operator: + __bool__(self) Determine the truth of a Modular value: non-0 values are True __eq__(self, other) Overload equal operator: == __ge__(self, other) Overload greater than or equal to operator: > __gt__(self, other) Overload greater than operator: > __init__(self, value, modulus) Instantiate like Modular(3,4) __le__(self, other) Overload less than or equal to operator: <= __lt__(self, other) Overload less than operator: < __mul__(self, other) Overload multiplication operator: * __ne__(self, other) Overload not equal operator: != __pow__(self, other) Overload power operator: * __radd__(self, other) Overload addition operator (for right operands): + __rmul__(self, other) Overload multiplication operator (for right operands): * __rpow__(self, other) Overload power operator: * __rsub__(self, other) Overload subtraction operator (for right operands): - __str__(self) Return a string representation for a Modular, such that m2 = eval(str(m1)) copies the state of m1 at the time of the call __sub__(self, other) Overload subtraction operator: - clear(self) Decrement value (modularly) by 1 dec(self) Decrement value (modularly) by 1 inc(self) Increment value (modularly) by 1 modulus(self) returns modulus of modular number value(self) returns current value of modular number Data descriptors defined here: __dict__ dictionary for instance variables (if defined) __weakref__ list of weak references to the object (if defined) Data and other attributes defined here: __hash__ = None
