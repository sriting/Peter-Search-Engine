Canto – or Crista Lopes in real life – is working with a colleague in Second Life to develop a search-engine for virtual shoppers to easily find what they are looking for. Canto’s research in the real world focuses on languages and communication systems. The ultimate goal of her research is to deepen the knowledge about communication, in particular in systems that involve humans and machines. With this utopic goal in mind, she has done work in a variety of fields such as programming languages, security and applications of audio signal processing. Second Life is a 3-D virtual world entirely built and owned by its residents. Since opening to the public in 2003, it has grown explosively and today is inhabited by a total of 5,905,638 people from around the globe. Several Bren School faculty are researching social interaction in the virtual world, as well as conducting classes and holding research group meetings.
