Again we use a convention as follows:
        http://www.foo.com/entity/_version_

This is because a version of an entity may consist of different versions
of component entities.  Generally speaking, each constituent of
configuration layers may have different version schemas and numbers.  For
example, version 3 of an entire document consists of version 4 of
a component and version 5 of another component.

Kenji
