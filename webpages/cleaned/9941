Held last fall, Med AppJam drew 30 medical students and 100 information and computer sciences students who teamed up to create, over just 10 days, iOS-based mobile applications useful to both physicians and patients. The annual Anteater Awards, presented by Student Life & Leadership, recognizes the accomplishments of UCI’s student organizations. “The ICS Student Council is the official student government for the Donald Bren School of Information and Computer Sciences,” explains Tony Givargis, computer science professor and associate dean for student affairs. “ICSSC organizes a number of fantastic events each year, and the school is tremendously proud of the council’s dedication to improving the academic, social and professional lives of our students.” More community Alumni Parents Leadership Council News Give a gift Quick Links - select a page - Computing support CS Seminar Series Employment Facilities Find faculty and staff Giving to the Bren School Graduate degrees Kay Family Foundation Lab Project ICS Prospective undergraduates Safety procedures Undergraduate degrees Copyright Inquiries | UCI Directory | Intranet
