To this end, we will develop a new powerful and scalable class of statistical models for studying multimodal neural data using Bayesian stochastic processes and computationally efficient algorithms. The potential clinical impact of this study is broad. Our research will address fundamental and unresolved questions about hippocampal function, and these novel approaches may subsequently lead to unprecedented insight into the neural mechanisms underlying memory impairments.
