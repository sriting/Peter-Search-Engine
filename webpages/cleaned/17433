New papers: Interact 2007, OzCHI 2007, DUX 2007 I'm on sabbatical 2007-08. Students It is my privilege to work with the rockin'-est, ass-kickin'-est students around. They can often be found squaring circles or proving P=NP. Working from their secret underground lunar base, they are the scourge of super-villains the world over, and regularly save the planet from alien invasion. (You haven't seen any alien invaders around, have you? See? They're that good.) Don't mess with my students.
