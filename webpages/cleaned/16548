David Eppstein - Publications David Eppstein - Publications Triangulating polygons without large angles. M. Bern, D. Dobkin, and D. Eppstein. 8th ACM Symp. Comp. Geom., Berlin, 1992, pp. 222–231. Int. J. Comp. Geom. & Appl. 5: 171–192, 1995 (special issue for 8th Symp. Comput. Geom.) Follows up "Polynomial size non-obtuse triangulation of polygons"; improves the number of triangles by relaxing the requirements on their angles. Again mostly subsumed by results of Bern et al described in "Faster circle packing". (BibTeX – Citations – CiteSeer) Publications – David Eppstein – Theory Group – Inf. & Comp.
