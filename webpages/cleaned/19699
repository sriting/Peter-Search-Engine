Forum for presentation and criticism by students of research work in progress. May be repeated for credit. Instructor's Description This seminar is an opportunity for students to give presentations about their research interests and on-going work. Talks can be more formal, such as powerpoint presentations that are practice for conference or job talks. They might be less formal such as a description of work-in-progress followed by a guided discussion of open issues. In both cases, the emphasis is on students learning to present their work and critically discuss the work of others. On the first meeting, students choose a time and preferably a topic for presenting during the quarter. David F.
