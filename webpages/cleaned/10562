Typically, a longer period of study (two to six years) is required for completion of all degree requirements. After a Ph.D. student has been registered for over 21 quarters (seven years), and a M.S. student has been registered for over six quarters (two years), they are considered to be beyond normative time for completing the degree. A letter regarding this status is sent to the student and to the department requesting a deadline be implemented for the student to complete all requirements and submit their dissertation. If this deadline is missed the student is subject to academic disqualification.
