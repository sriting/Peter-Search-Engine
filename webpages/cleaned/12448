It includes many areas such as theorem-proving, game playing, propositional satis ability, constraint satisfaction, planning, scheduling, probabilistic inference and decision-making. This dissertation is focused on reasoning in graphical frameworks such as constraint and belief networks, where domain knowledge is represented by a graph depicting variables as nodes and dependencies (e.g., propositional clauses, constraints, probabilities, and utilities) as edges. Some reasoning tasks can be formulated as combinatorial optimization or constraint satisfaction problems, while others can be viewed as knowledge compilation, or inference. We approach those tasks using a general graph-based algorithmic framework that combines a dynamic-programming technique called variable elimination with backtracking search, and investigate the effect of problem structure on the performance of such algorithms.
