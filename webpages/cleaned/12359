Conformant planning problem is formulated as probabilistic inference in graphical models compiled from relational PPDDL domains.The translation from PPDDL into Dynamic Bayesian Network is developed by mapping the SAT encoding of the ground PPDDL into factored representation. We experimented with recently developed AND/OR branch and bound search algorithms for marginal MAP over instances from the international planning competition domains, and we show that several domains were solved efficiently.
