Rescue Dissemination Project Home People Research Introduction Dissemination Scenarios Customization Needs Delivery Infrastructure Results and Artifacts Publications Workshops Classes Related Links SocioTechnical Approaches to Information Dissemination Outline Given the current trend to obtain information anytime and anywhere, Information Dissemination is a critical technology/service for future generations under a variety of scenarios. In this course, we will develop an understanding of the key factors in effective dissemination to the public at large and design technology innovations to enable faster, robust and more effective content dissemination. For example, in the context of crisis alert systems, conveying accurate and timely information to those who are actually at risk (or likely to be), while providing reassuring information to those who are not at risk will provide a better response to the crisis at hand. The course will explore key factors that pose significant challenges (social and technological) to effective information dissemination. These factors include variation in notification times for different applications (e.g. warning times in the emergency response case), determining the specificity of information to effectively communicate to different populations, and customization of the delivery process to reach the targeted populations in time over unreliable infrastructures and networks. The course will also explore how effective dissemination requires a multidisciplinary approach that understands and utilizes the context in which the dissemination of information occurs to determine sources, recipients, channels of targeted messages develop technological solutions that can deliver appropriate and accessible information to the public rapidly. From a social science perspective, we will look into models and theories for information diffusion in social networks and the role of traditional and alternative independent communication technologies (blogs, social networks ala FaceBook, MySpace) in effectively reaching the target audience. From a information technology and systems perspective, we will look at techniques to build highly customized, robust and timely dissemination services from unstable and unreliable resources over both wired and wireless networks using a variety of technologies such as peer-based architectures, wireless mesh networks and publish/subscribe architectures.
