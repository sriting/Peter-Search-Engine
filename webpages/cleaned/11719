Arcadia Collected Papers: ABSTRACT Collected Arcadia Papers Arcadia Papers: ABSTRACT "Approaches to Specification-Based Testing", by Debra J. Richardson, Owen O'Malley and Cindy Tittle in Proceedings of the Third ACM SIGSOFT Symposium on Software Testing, Analysis and Verification, pages 86-96, Keywest, December 1989. Abstract Current software testing practices focus, almost exclusively, on the implementation, despite widely acknowledged benefits of testing based on software specifications. We propose approaches to specification-based testing by extending a wide variety of implementation-based testing techniques to be applicable to formal specification languages. We demonstrate these approaches for the Anna and Larch specification languages. The Arcadia Project <arcadia-www@ics.uci.edu> Last modified: Fri Nov 11 14:42:51 1994
