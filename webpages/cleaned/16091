Replicators: B01468/S02 Replicators: B01468/S02 B01468/S02 has a small 9c/20 replicator: Replicators can cancel each other around corners, forming large square replicator-based oscillators. From random initial conditions, this rule develops a chaotic patchword of small regions of live and dead cells. Replicators -- Cellular Automata -- D. Eppstein -- UCI Inf. & Comp. Sci.
