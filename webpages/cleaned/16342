Closest Pair Applications Closest Pair Data Structures: Applications The following algorithms and applications can be implemented efficiently using our new closest pair data structures, or involve closest pair computation as important subroutines. Dynamic minimum spanning trees Two-optimization heuristics in combinatorial optimization Straight skeletons and roof design Ray-intersection diagram Other collision detection applications Hierarchical clustering Traveling salesman heuristics Greedy matching Constructive induction Gr√∂bner bases David Eppstein, Information & Computer Science, UC Irvine, .
