Constraint satisfaction and propagation tools, as well as constraint programming languages, are successfully used to model, solve, and reason about many classes of problems, such as design, diagnosis, scheduling, spatio-temporal reasoning, resource allocation, configuration, network optimization, and graphical interfaces.
