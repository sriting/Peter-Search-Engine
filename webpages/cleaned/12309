Dr. Rina Dechter @ UCI [an error occurred while processing this directive] Publications & Technical Reports R161 | Approximate Solution Sampling (and Counting) on AND/OR spaces Vibhav Gogate and Rina Dechter Abstract In this paper, we describe a new algorithm for sampling solutions from a uniform distribution over the solutions of a constraint network. Our new algorithm improves upon the Sampling/Importance Resampling (SIR) component of our previous scheme of SampleSearch-SIR by taking advantage of the decomposition implied by the networkï¿½s AND/OR search space.We also describe how our new scheme can approximately count and lower bound the number of solutions of a constraint network. We demonstrate both theoretically and empirically that our new algorithm yields far better performance than competing approaches.
