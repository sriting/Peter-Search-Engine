Brian G Vegetabile | UC Irvine Brian G. Vegetabile Statistics Ph.D. Candidate at the University of California, Irvine bvegetab [atsymbol] uci [dotedu] I'm a fifth year PhD candidate studying statistics at the University of California, Irvine working under the advisement of Dr. Hal Stern. My research interests are in Bayesian inference and statistical machine learning techniques as they apply to causal inference in observational studies for studying human behavior. I am also passionate about statistical computing and data visualization. Recently, I have been investigating nonparametric techniques for estimating treatment assignment mechanisms in observational settings. Publications Elysia Poggi Davis, Stephanie A.
