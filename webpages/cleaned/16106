Replicators: B3568/S2347 Replicators: B3568/S2347 I found this replicator on Oct. 27, 2001. It repeats every 4 generations, on a one-dimensional 2-unit grid. This rule has a few known spaceships. It is unknown whether the replicator can lead to high-period oscillators, spaceships, guns, or other interesting technology. Replicators -- Cellular Automata -- D. Eppstein -- UCI Inf. & Comp. Sci.
