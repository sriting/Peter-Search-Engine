Replicators: B25/S4 Replicators: B25/S4 Like the one in B2/S13, this replicator copies itself every three generations on a one-dimensional 3-unit grid. However, the replicator is asymmetric. When started from a single copy, adjacent replicators will always meet head-to-head or tail-to-tail, but the replication action still works if they are set up to meet head-to-tail. B25/S4 has several interesting known spaceships, including small c/2 orthogonal and c/8 diagonal ships. Replicators -- Cellular Automata -- D. Eppstein -- UCI Inf. & Comp. Sci.
