OEIter<T>& operator = (OEIter<T> &rhs)
 The assignment operator initializes the OEIter to the given OEIterBase, typically returned by an OEChem or OESystem function. If the OEIter has already been initialized, the internal OEIterBase is destroy and replaced with the new value. An OEIter may be assigned the value of another OEIter in which case a copy of the rhs iterator is made using the OEIter<T>::Copy method.
