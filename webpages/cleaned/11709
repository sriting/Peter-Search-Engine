Arcadia Collected Papers: ABSTRACT Arcadia Papers: ABSTRACT "A Flexible Architecture for Building Data Flow Analyzers", by Matthew B. Dwyer and Lori A. Clarke in Technical Report 94-082, Department of Computer Science, University of Massachusetts at Amherst, 1994. Abstract Data flow analysis is a versatile technique that can be used to address a variety of analysis problems. Typically, data flow analyzers are handcrafted to solve a particular analysis problem. In this paper, we describe an architecture for data flow analyzers along with a library of components and component generators that can be employed to build data flow analyzers. We further extend the architecture to support the development of analyzers for qualified data flow analysis problems. We describe our experience using this architecture to construct several prototype data flow analyzers. The Arcadia Project <arcadia-www@ics.uci.edu> Last modified: Thu Jan 26 13:50:36 1995
