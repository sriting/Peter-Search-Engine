squared_radius Navigation: Up, Table of Contents, Bibliography, Index, Title Page CGAL::squared_radius FT squared_radius ( Point_2<Kernel> p, Point_2<Kernel> q, Point_2<Kernel> r) compute the squared radius of the circle passing through the points p , q , and r . Precondition: p , q , and r are not collinear. FT squared_radius ( Point_2<Kernel> p, Point_2<Kernel> q) compute the squared radius of the smallest circle passing through p , and q , i.e. one fourth of the squared distance between p and q . FT squared_radius ( Point_3<Kernel> p, Point_3<Kernel> q, Point_3<Kernel> r, Point_3<Kernel> s) compute the squared radius of the sphere passing through the points p , q , r and s . Precondition: p , q , r and s are not coplanar. FT squared_radius ( Point_3<Kernel> p, Point_3<Kernel> q, Point_3<Kernel> r) compute the squared radius of the sphere passing through the points p , q , and r and whose center is in the same plane as those three points. FT squared_radius ( Point_3<Kernel> p, Point_3<Kernel> q) compute the squared radius of the smallest circle passing through p , and q , i.e. one fourth of the squared distance between p and q .
