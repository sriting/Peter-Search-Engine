Implementation of Caching and Replication techniques in middleware environments. Integrating fault-tolerance protocols into distributed middleware infrastructures. Storage and I/O management in distributed middleware Customizability and Reflection in middleware systems Event services in distributed environments Formal Specification of Distributed Systems Middleware Middleware for Mobile Environments - e.g. wireless, satellite Middleware Services for Grid Computing and High Performance Computing systems System support for sensor networks Middleware for Real-time Embedded Systems Middleware for MM Systems - admission control, resource reservation etc. Policies for Resource Discovery in wide-area environments Implementation of Flexible Naming Techniques in DSM Integration of video and network protocols - e.g. MPEG/ATM, MPEG/IP. QoS based middleware, e.g. integration of QoS-sensitive server policies and network protocols. Group communication facilities in distributed systems middleware. Incorporation of security policies in middleware environments. Middleware support for virtual environments and 3D graphics/animation. Applications , development of web services, e.g. billing service
