Eric Nalisnick | UC Irvine eric nalisnick PhD Candidate Computer Science University of California, Irvine Room 4228 Donald Bren Hall Irvine, CA 92617 enalisni [at] uci [dot] edu about cv code twitter I've moved to the University of Cambridge. My current webpage can be found HERE. I am a PhD candidate in the Computer Science Department at the University of California, Irvine. Padhraic Smyth is my advisor. My research interests reside in both the theory and application of Bayesian models, with a emphasis on choosing priors and incorportating neural networks for inference. I've done research internships at Amazon, Microsoft Research / Bing, and Twitter Cortex. I graduated from Lehigh University (Bethlehem, PA) where I worked with Henry Baird.
