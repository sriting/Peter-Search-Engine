I'm not sure of the role for the cookie in this (just call me dense (later
on in this mail I guess why you might use one)). But the reservation and
context establishment should be handled by LOCK. If a server requires
special reservation for editing, it's the client's responsibility to obtain
a lock on the file before doing a PUT. If the client already has a cached
copy, a "conditional GET" based on the version at the server might be
useful.

I think decoupling the access control aspects (LOCKing and so forth) from
the GET/PUT operations gives us a lot more generality, extremely easily. I
don't see any situation where "get for edit" is really different from "LOCK
resource for writing" followed by GET. If the client has a local copy, the
GET could even be conditional on the version they have being a leaf (though
this would not be a requirement). Then we might even be able to PUT a few
times before releasing the lock!

Attempts to PUT without a needed lock could bounce on servers that need or
want to enforce such a discipline on their clients.

In the requirements, since "GET for edit" is the same as GET, this is a given.

Now we get into Yaron's requirements (about which I can only comment in
general terms. However I'll note that a lot of the file-management
operations (DELETE, COPY, MKDIR) seem to me to be out of scope of
Versioning (and maybe even collaborative editing). I also don't think that
HTTP resources map 1-1 into filesystem objects, and would like to keep the
separation in our standards.

I don't necessarily want to suggest that we rule out these operations, but
they seem to be more general HTTP issues than versioning or authoring
issues to me.

Can you guys explain the cookies to me? Do we use a hash (like MD5) to
determine if another GET is required, or what? At any rate,as I've said
already a few times, I think that separation of concerns makes "GET for
edit" into a composite operation.

Well, Brainocide sounds fun to the researcher in me... But I agree with Jim
(if that's what he really means) that versioned directories belong with
configuration management in the second phase of versioning work: there are
a lot of dissimilar/funky models of this stuff floating around, and we will
need to find a clean compromise. I think this needs to go to the back
burner for the immediate crunch of work.

Locking is better IMHO than special variants of GET. Let's make the
concerns of access and update completely separate.

I'm trying not to be a partisan for my own point of view, but rather to
find common ground that covers all the versioning scenarios around. But I
will note that my goal is to make locking unnecessary for some kinds of
collaborative update. Now, my research may fail, but separating locking
functionality from GET functionality doesn't hurt the rest of the world,
and lets my kind of apporach fit in with the world.

   Anyway, even systems like CVS try to keep locking to a bare minimum, so
it's not just me...

HTTP has flourished on the basis of incredible simplicity and orthogonality
-- so even though versioning is complex, let's try to preserve these
virtues to the greatest extent that we can...
