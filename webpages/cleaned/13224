Regular_triangulation_filtered_traits_3<FK> Navigation: Up, Table of Contents, Bibliography, Index, Title Page CGAL::Regular_triangulation_filtered_traits_3<FK> Definition The class Regular_triangulation_filtered_traits_3<FK> is designed as a traits class for the class Regular_triangulation_3<RegularTriangulationTraits_3,TriangulationDataStructure_3>. Its difference with Regular_triangulation_euclidean_traits_3 is that it provides filtered predicates which are meant to be fast and exact. The first argument FK must be a model of the Kernel concept, and it is also restricted to be a instance of the Filtered_kernel template. #include <CGAL/Regular_triangulation_filtered_traits_3.h> Is Model for the ConceptRegularTriangulationTraits_3 Inherits FromRegular_triangulation_euclidean_traits_3<FK> See Also CGAL::Regular_triangulation_euclidean_traits_3.
