AREM: Aligning ChIP-seq reads by Expectation-Maximization.

</div>

<h5>Description</h5>
<div class="level5">

<p>
AREM takes the classic peak calling algorithm used in MACS 1.4 (including an empirically optimal tag shift and a locally-adjusted poissonian statistical model for tag enrichment) and adds a component for realigning ambigously mapping reads.  A probabilistic model assigns reads to regions that are more likely to be peaks (having higher enrichment).
