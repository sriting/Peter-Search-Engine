Theory Seminar, December 7, 2012 CS 269S, Fall 2012: Theory Seminar Bren Hall, Room 1423, 1pm December 7, 2012: Morphing Planar Graph Drawings with Bent Edges Pawel Pszona I will present an algorithm for computing a discrete (consisting of a polynomial number of linear morphs) planar morph between two planar straight-line drawings of a graph. It achieves polynomial size at the expense of allowing edge bends. (A paper by A. Lubiw and M. Petrick)
