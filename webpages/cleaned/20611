Theory Seminar, March 1, 2012 CS 269S, Winter 2012: Theory Seminar Bren Hall, Room 1423, 1pm March 1, 2013: Max flows in O(nm) time, or better Will Devanny We present improved polynomial time algorithms for the max flow problem defined on a network with n nodes and m arcs. We show how to solve the max flow problem in O(nm) time, improving upon the best previous algorithm due to King, Rao, and Tarjan, who solved the max flow problem in O(nm logm/(n log n) n) time. In the case that m = O(n), we improve the running time to O(n2/log n). We further improve the running time in the case that U* = Umax/Umin is not too large, where Umax denotes the largest finite capacity and Umin denotes the smallest non-zero capacity. If log(U*) = O(n1/3 log−3 n), we show how to solve the max flow problem in O(nm/log n) steps. In the case that log(U*) = O(logk n) for some fixed positive integer k, we show how to solve the max flow problem in Õ(n8/3) time. This latter algorithm relies on a subroutine for fast matrix multiplication. (Based on a preprint by James B. Orlin.)
