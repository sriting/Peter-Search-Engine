                   MockCGIFieldStorage
 Mock object to simulate cgi.FieldStorage for testing purposes. All methods may not implemented (stupid, no defined interfaces / pure virtual abstract classes) so may need to add more methods as application uses them. Instance Methods [hide private] addMockField(self, key, value) Real cgi.FieldStorage instances are readonly, and thus do not support such a method. Inherited from UserDict.UserDict: __cmp__, __contains__, __delitem__, __getitem__, __init__, __len__, __repr__, __setitem__, clear, copy, get, has_key, items, iteritems, iterkeys, itervalues, keys, pop, popitem, setdefault, update, values Class Methods [hide private] Inherited from UserDict.UserDict: fromkeys Method Details [hide private] addMockField(self, key, value) Real cgi.FieldStorage instances are readonly, and thus do not support such a method. This is what allows the test developer to manufacture a Mock request object. >>> mockForm = MockCGIFieldStorage()
>>> mockForm.addMockField("MyField","MyValue")
>>> mockForm["MyField"].value
