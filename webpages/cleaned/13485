 Write a molecule to an output oemolstream. The molecule is written to the output oemolstream in the file format currently associated with that oemolstream. This method is equivalent to the OEWriteMolecule function. The return value returns the state of the stream after the write allowing multiple Â« operators to be chained together. This (high-level) method may automatically update the aromaticity, atom names and atom and bond types and reorder the atoms and bonds of a molecule to achieve the appropriate molecular file format variant. OEChem also contains low-level file I/O APIs that allow finer control over the variants of molecular file formats read and written.
