 using the CFTP algorithm described in [Propp & Wilson, '96]
 INPUTS:
           model:(1 X 1) struct array with fields
                       N: number of nodes
                       w: (N X N) matrix of interactions
                       b: (N X 1) vector of biases
           numSamples: Number of samples to generate
           rep01     : the representation - 
                       1 if nodes take values from {0,1}
                       0 if nodes take values from {-1,+1}
 RETURNS:
           samples: (numSamples X N) array of samples

 NOTE: WE MIGHT BE ABLE TO IMRPOVE THE CODE A LOT BY STORING JUST THE RANDOM GENERATOR 
       STATES AT TIMES T=2^k, INSTEAD OF THE ACTUAL NUMBERS! CROSS-REFERENCE INFORMATION This function calls: This function is called by: Generated on Wed 28-Sep-2005 04:10:02 by m2html Â© 2003
