      [an error occurred while processing this directive] Publications & Technical Reports R137 | Cutset Sampling for Bayesian Networks Bozhena Bidyuk and Rina Dechter Abstract The paper presents a new sampling methodology for Bayesian networks that samples only a subset of variables and applies exact inference to the rest. Cutset sampling is a network structure-exploiting application of the Rao-Blackwellisation principle to sampling in Bayesian networks. It improves convergence by exploiting memory-based inference al- gorithms. It can also be viewed as an anytime approximation of exact cutset-conditioning algorithm (Pearl, 1988). Cutset sampling can be implemented efficiently when the sampled variables constitute a loop-cutset of the Bayesian network and, more generally, when the induced width of the networkï¿½s graph conditioned on the observed sampled variables is bounded by a constant w. We demonstrate empirically the benefit of this scheme on a range of benchmarks.
