David Eppstein - Publications David Eppstein - Publications Parallel recognition of series parallel graphs. D. Eppstein. Information & Computation 98: 41–55, 1992. Characterizes two-terminal series graphs in terms of a tree-like structure in their ear decompositions. Uses this characterization to construct parallel algorithms that recognize these graphs and construct their series-parallel decompositions.
