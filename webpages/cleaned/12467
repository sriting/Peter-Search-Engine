In multiply connected network, IBP is only guaranteed to converge in linear time to the correct posterior marginals when evidence nodes form a loop-cutset. We propose an e-cutset criteria that IBP will converge and compute posterior marginals close to correct when a single value in the domain of each loop-cutset node receives very strong support compared to other values thus producing an effect similar to the observed loop-cutset. We investigate the support for this criteria analytically and empirically and show thatit is consistent with previous observations of IBP performance in multiply connected networks.
