Computer Science Conference}, publisher = {Assoc. Comput. Mach.}, pages = {44}, year = {1975}, abstract = {Most Information Retrieval Systems (IRS) that have been implemented to date have many restrictions imposed on the user for the convenience of the system programmer. Among these restrictions two common ones are (1) requiring the user to declare the structure of all the records beforehand, and (2) requiring the user to maintain a detailed knowledge of these structures at query time. A design for an IRS is proposed in which both of these problems are alleviated. A Relational Data Base System in the style of Codd's work is described that allows the data itself to define the structure of each stored record differently from every other record. At query time, the user is not required to have any knowledge of these structures, but merely be aware of the relationships that exist between the various data items. These relationships may be represented as a digraph, where the nodes model the data items, and the edges model the relationships. With this model, a query is equivalent to finding a given subgraph of a graph.}} @unpublished{Abd-95, title = {{Parallel implementation of graph matching for object recognition}}, author = {M. A.

The authors prove that there is a set $X$ of no more than $h^{3/2}n^{1/2}$ vertices of $G$ whose deletion creates a graph in which the total weight of every connected component is at most $1/2$. They exhibit an algorithm which finds, given an $n$-vertex graph $G$ with weights as above and an $h$-vertex graph $H$, either such a set $X$ or a minor of $G$ isomorphic to $H$. The algorithm runs in time $O(h^{1/2}n^{1/2}m)$, where $m$ is the number of edges of $G$ plus the number of its vertices. The authors' results supply extensions of the many known applications of the Lipton-Tarjan separator theorem (1979,1980) from the class of planar graphs (or that of graphs with bounded genus) to any class of graphs with an excluded minor. For example, it follows that for any fixed graph $H$, given a graph $G$ with $n$ vertices and with no $H$-minor one can approximate the size of the maximum independent set of $G$ up to a relative error of $1/\sqrt{\log{n}}$ in polynomial time, find that size exactly and find the chromatic number of $G$ in time $2^{O(\sqrt{n})}$ and solve any sparse system of $n$ linear equations in $n$ unknowns whose sparsity structure corresponds to $G$ in time $O(n^{3/2})$.

The randomized algorithms obtained using this method can be derandomized using families of perfect hash functions. Using the color-coding method we obtain, among others, the following new results: for every fixed $k$, if a graph $G=(V, E)$ contains a simple cycle of size exactly $k$, then such a cycle can be found in either $O(V^\omega)$ expected time or $O(V^\omega\log{V})$ worst-case time, where $\omega<2.376$ is the exponent of matrix multiplication. (Here and in what follows we use $V$ and $E$ instead of $|V|$ and $|E|$ whenever no confusion may arise.) For every fixed $k$, if a planar graph $G=(V, E)$ contains a simple cycle of size exactly $k$, then such a cycle can be found in either $O(V)$ expected time or $O(V\log{V})$ worst-case time. The same algorithm applies, in fact, not only to planar graphs, but to any minor closed family of graphs which is not the family of all graphs. If a graph $G=(V, E)$ contains a subgraph isomorphic to a bounded tree-width graph $H=(V_H,E_H)$ where $|V_H|=O(\log{V})$, then such a copy of $H$ can be found in polynomial time. This was not previously known even if $H$ were just a path of length $O(\log{V})$. These results improve upon previous results of many authors.

The authors show that $G$ is never a spanning subgraph of $D$ when $n$ is greater than three or when $n$ equals three and $m$ is greater than two. For $n=3$ and $m=2$, the authors can show for wide classes of graphs that $G$ cannot be a spanning subgraph of $D$.

For $n=2$ the situation is quite different: the authors present a sufficient condition for a Cartesian product $G$ to be a spanning subgraph of $D=D_B(2)$.

Massively-parallel implementations of the method are discussed, using the AMT Distributed Array Processor.

The use of Ullmann's (1976) subgraph isomorphism algorithm with these representations permits the identification of all occurrences of all possible beta -sheet motifs in a 114-protein subset of the Protein Data Bank. A binary notation is used to describe the parallel or antiparallel characters of adjacent strands in a sheet, and it is shown that very few of the possible types of sheet are found to occur in practice. Similar conclusions are obtained using a more detailed notation that includes the sheets' topological connectivities. The latter notation enables searches to be carried out for psi -loops and allows the identification of 20 proteins that had not previously been known to contain this type of loop. The nodes in the second type of protein graph describe the amino acid residues in protein structures and the edges the geometric relationships between pairs of these residues.

The substructure search is based on the concept of fuzziness: it is expressed in terms of subgraph isomorphism between a set of fuzzy graphs and a set of graphs. The file to be searched is processed by an automat which generates multilevel fuzzy graphs corresponding to local descriptions of the defined structures. The DARC descriptions of these graphs are stored in a tree structure. The same process is applied to the fuzzy graph of a query. As a result of this approach, the user language is the natural language of the chemist: free drawing of the substructural diagram with no use of a dictionary for the search. The retrieved structures can be displayed on a graphic terminal. These principles have been applied to the full CAS Registry Structure File and have made possible, for the first time, online substructure searches on 5 million compounds (EURECAS).

The characters are detected in the order defined by the matching quality. Each subgraph that is recognized is introduced as a node in a direct net that compiles different alternatives of interpretation of the features in the feature graph. A path in the net represents a consistent succession of characters in the word. The method allows the recognition of characters that overlap, or that are underlined. A final search for the optimal path under certain criteria gives the best interpretation of the word features. The character recognizer uses a flexible matching between the features and a flexible grouping of the individual features to be matched. Broken characters are recognized by looking for gaps between features that may be interpreted as part of a character. Touching characters are recognized because the matching allows non-matched adjacent features. The recognition results of this system on over 4000 printed numeral characters belonging to a USPS database and on some hand printed words confirmed the method's high robustness level.}} @inproceedings{SabAgg-TVIP-93, title = {{Hypergraph based feature matching in a sequence of range images}}, author = {B.

For this reason the paper presents a method to make the recognition approach applicable for perspective views too. After discussing some basic properties of perspective Hough spaces the authors propose a method for detecting vanishing points in Hough space. They are used to reconstruct an orthographic view of the perspectively observed image by orthogonalizing cluster patterns in Hough space. Recognition is realized by matching graphs extracted from these orthogonalized patterns to model graphs by means of an attributed subgraph isomorphism detection algorithm. It is supported substantially by 3D information extracted from the perspective image by vanishing point detection.

However, interaction of features creates difficulties since the adjacency information between some faces is lost. We derive this lost information by considering faces that when extended intersect other faces to form concave edges. The derived face adjacencies are termed virtual links. Augmenting the virtual links to the cavity graph of the object leads to its feature graph, and subgraph matching of primitive graphs in this graph results in feature hypotheses. A feature hypothesis is considered valid if the volume corresponding to it is not shared with the part in question; therefore, we verify the feature hypotheses by checking the regularized intersection of the feature volume and the part.
