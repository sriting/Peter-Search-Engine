Arcadia Collected Papers: ABSTRACT Arcadia Papers: ABSTRACT "User Interface Design Assistance for Large-Scale Software Development", by Gregory Alan Bolcer in Proceedings of the Knowledge Based Software Engineering Conference, pages 142-149, Monterey, CA, September 1994. Abstract The User Interface Design Assistant (UIDA) addresses the specific design problems of style and integration consistency throughout the user interface development process and aids in the automated feedback and evaluation of a system's graphical user interface according to knowledge-based rules and project specific design examples. The UIDA system is able to quickly identify inconsistent style guide interpretations and UI design decisions resulting from distributed development of multiple UI sub-systems. This case arises when each sub-system conforms to the general style guide rules, but when integrated together, may appear inconsistent.
