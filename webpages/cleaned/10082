Ito will team with the Connected Learning Research Network, which she directs at UCI, the Los Angeles Public Library, the Young Adult Library Services Association and the YOUmedia Learning Labs Network to conduct the research. “This initiative will fill a significant gap in today’s informal learning landscape by providing libraries with practical tools to evaluate the learning opportunities they provide for young people,” said Beth Yoke, YALSA’s executive director. “Ultimately, the nation’s youth will benefit from the enhanced opportunities that libraries will be able to provide as a result of this research project.” For more information, view the official news release.
