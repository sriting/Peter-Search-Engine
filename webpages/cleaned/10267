An emerging field of study in information and computer sciences, Statistics faculty members bring with them a strength in statistical theory and a focus on the development of statistical methods for solving problems. Researchers at UCI are concerned with developing and studying methods for collecting, analyzing, interpreting and presenting empirical data. Statistical principles and methods are important for addressing questions in public policy, medicine, industry and virtually every branch of science.
