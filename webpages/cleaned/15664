This retrieval of the the relationships can be accomplished two
different ways: create a new method: "HISTORY", or perhaps
"INDEX"; provide a cgi-bin which takes a URL and returns the
history.  The former ensures that the functionality is always
available in a standard way, while the latter keeps the protocol
small.

While the server is the final arbiter when it comes to what, if
any, version identifier (VID) is assigned to a checked-in
version, the protocol should provide a mechanism for the client
to specify the desired VID.  (This becomes important in an
SCCS-based environment, since SCCS allows a single user to have
multiple different versions of the same file locked.  The user
must specify which version she's checking in.)

Given that the requirements of the (deleted) point 5 are met,
then yes, this is a server issue.

I agree with David.  authorization (security) and authentication
(identity) issues are server issues.  In the words of the ANSI C
standard, it's a "quality of implementation" issue.

Well, it's non-minimal but, in the long run, configuration
management is important.  We have to leave room in the early
specification for CM to be slotted in later.  One interesting
problem is that, given that a user has a set of pages that are
consistent, how does she check them <em>all</> in and ensure that
the server's view of the world is always consistent?

David's right.  This is quality of implementation again.  A
server that hangs loose and lets just anybody check in or lock
pages, with no way to tighten access up, won't win.
