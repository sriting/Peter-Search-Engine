Theory Seminar, 29 Oct 2004 ICS 269, Fall 2004: Theory Seminar 29 Oct 2004: Minimum Dilation Stars David Eppstein and Kevin Wortman The dilation of a Euclidean graph is defined as the ratio of distance in the graph divided by distance in Rd. We consider the problem of positioning the root of a star such that the dilation of the resulting graph is minimal. We present a deterministic O(n log n)-time solution to the decision problem, as well as a randomized O(n log n) expected-time solution to the optimization problem. The talk will cover selected results from a paper currently under preparation.
