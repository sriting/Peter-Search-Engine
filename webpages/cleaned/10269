Lopes »Bill Tomlinson Ubiquitous computing refers to the creation and deployment of computing technology in such a way that it becomes an invisible part of the fabric of everyday life and commerce. In the ubiquitous computing era, computers in the traditional sense gradually fade from view. Information and communication mediated by computers is available anywhere and anytime through devices that are embedded in our environment, completely inter-connected, intuitive, effortlessly portable and constantly available. Users share information and communicate continuously throughout the day. In short, ubiquitous computing provides computing for all - access to anything, by anyone, at anytime, anywhere. Advances in wireless networking and the Internet, embedded systems and human-computer interaction are the forerunners for ubiquitous computing. It is the convergence of these and other technologies that brings about the trend towards ubiquitous computing. Ubiquitous computing places considerable requirements on both hardware and software development and support, increasing needs for information and data analysis, and also leads to new applications that improve society. Ubiquitous computing builds upon and unites virtually all of the current research strengths in the Bren School. With particular emphasis on ubiquitous computing, the Bren School faculty are addressing issues such as context-aware computing, whereby mobile computing responds to one's current context.
