As the only computing-focused school in the University of California system, the Bren School is a unique place for study, research and collaboration. Our three departments — Computer Science, Informatics and Statistics — incorporate a broad range of curricular and research interests across the informational and computational sciences. The school offers a range of undergraduate majors, including recently developed majors in Computer Game Science and Data Science. The diverse selection of majors enables students to gain in-depth knowledge of the information and computer sciences while developing an understanding of the broad reach of the discipline. Our goal is to give students the real-world tools necessary to succeed in the ever-changing technology industry. Our faculty and graduate students are leaders in their research areas which span information and computer sciences; they obtain corporate and federal extramural grants, they write leading textbooks in their fields, publish influential journal articles, and participate in key conferences and workshops. Research in the information and computer sciences is applicable across many scholarly and scientific fields. Indeed, applications to scientific and policy questions in the biological/health, engineering, and social science disciplines motivate much of our research. I invite you to explore our website and learn more about the Bren School. Please feel free to contact me at icsdean@ics.uci.edu if you have questions or comments. Thanks, Marios C.
