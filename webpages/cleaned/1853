Lab members Matthew Bietz, Cory Knobel, and Katie Pine presented a tutorial on Values in Design for Collaborative Systems at the 2013 International Conference on Collaboration Technologies and Systems in San Diego. In the tutorial we provided an introduction to human-centered computing, explored the Values in Design concept, and then worked through a series of case-based design exercises focused on understanding stakeholders, eliciting values, and designing from a particular value standpoint. The case examples were drawn from Katie Pine’s examination of the use of Electronic Medical Record systems in labor and delivery rooms. Slides from the presentation are available on SlideShare.

Reply Coursework writing says: July 9, 2018 at 4:44 am Designing great user experiences is fundamentally a reflective procedure of asking what works, why, and how might we improve. As far as we can tell, authoritative success is about building a functional and collaborative user encounter for your own teams. Actively reflect on what worked, and drive consistent learning and refinement of your own processes and approaches.
