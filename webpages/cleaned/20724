Theory Seminar, 30 May 1997 ICS 269, Spring 1997: Theory Seminar 30 May 1997: Using Random Sampling to Find Maximum Flows Dan Halem, ICS, UC Irvine We present new algorithms, based on random sampling, that find maximum flows in undirected uncapcitated graphs. Our algorithms dominate augmenting paths over all parameter values (number of vertices and edges and flow value). They also dominate blocking flows over a large range of parameter values. Furthermore, they achieve time bounds on graphs with parallel (equivalently, capacitated) edges that previously could only be achieved on graphs without them. From a STOC '97 paper by David Karger.
