My question (from San Mateo) was whether the notion of "current version"
for cacheability is so different from the notion of "current version" for
versioning that we need an additional layer beyond the ETags.  (and in
the rather narrow scope of preventing conflicting overwrites)

I imagine the most common system would be a "major/minor" sort of thing,
where minor revisions were bumped on every change (and hence equivalent
to strong tags), and major revisions were bumped when the content had
changed to the point where the provider no longer wished it to be cached
(and hence equivalent to weak tags).

I admit this is a very naive view of versioning, but I'm not sure that
it helps to add complexity.  Can anyone post a scenario where it is
important to decouple cacheability from the version id?
