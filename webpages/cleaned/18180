ICS 156: Networking Lab 3.5.1 ICMP Redirects nWhen a source sends a packet to a gateway for forwarding, and that gateway is not the default next hop, then the gateway will forward the packet to the appropriate gateway. It then uses ICMP to send a message to the source giving it the gateway IP address that should be used next time in conjunction with that destination. nIf one examines the routing table after an ICMP redirect, we see that a new entry has been added and the flag �D� inserted to indicate its source.
