      [an error occurred while processing this directive] Publications & Technical Reports R100 | Bayesian Inference in the Presence of Determinism David Larkin and Rina Dechter Abstract In this paper, we consider the problem of performing inference on Bayesian networks which exhibit a substantial degree of determinism. We improve upon the determinismexploiting inference algorithm presented in [4], showing that the information brought to light by constraint propagation may be exploited to a much greater extent than has been previously possible. This is con.rmed with theoretical and empirical studies.
