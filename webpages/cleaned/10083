Carey attended the 32nd IEEE International Conference on Data Engineering (ICDE) in May to accept the award, as well as to give an invited talk titled "Beyond Rows and Columns: Is the Fourth Time the Charm?" (Download Carey’s presentation slides.) TCDE commends Carey for his “leadership and research excellence in building impactful data management systems, engineering tools, products, and practices.” The award recognizes database researchers with broad-reaching impact in fields beyond data engineering, like computer science, engineering or education. Only one researcher is honored with the prestigious award annually. According to the ICDE website, the annual conference “addresses research issues in designing, building, managing, and evaluating advanced data systems and applications. It is a leading forum for researchers, practitioners, developers, and users to explore cutting-edge ideas and to exchange techniques, tools, and experiences.” This year’s conference is held in Helsinki, Finland, due to the city’s numerous contributions in the areas of software engineering, mobile communications and computing, databases and data mining.
