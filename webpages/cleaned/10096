Current data analysis tools lack the theoretical foundation as well as computational complexity and scalability to find effective and computationally feasible methods for processing and analyzing very large datasets, the research team notes. Ultimately, Shahbaba and the research team will develop novel techniques to be applied to real computationally intensive problems from the biological sciences. “Due to its interdisciplinary nature, this research is expected to contribute to several fields, including statistics, machine learning, applied mathematics, and data-intensive computing,” the research team notes. The NSF award comes from its Division of Mathematical Sciences (DMS), which supports research in mathematics and statistics, training through research involvement of the next generation of mathematical scientists, conferences and workshops, and a portfolio of national mathematical sciences research institutes.
