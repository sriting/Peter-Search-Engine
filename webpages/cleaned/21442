Dean's Ambassadors Council – Closing the gap between students and faculty in the School of Social Sciences as well as the rest of the UCI community Dean's Ambassadors Council Closing the gap between students and faculty in the School of Social Sciences as well as the rest of the UCI community Menu Home Members Calendar Resources SocSciNetwork Contact Us Apply Welcome to our Council! Representing the UCI School of Social Sciences undergraduate students, we strive to promote meaning interactions between students and faculty, give back to our Social Sciences community, and build a strong progressive environment for our students. Our council works in tandem with the school’s administration and faculty. Our efforts focus on bringing together students and faculty to work together towards breaking the mold through various events including: Fall Festivals, Hot Topics Debate, First-Generation Alumni Career Panel, and Dean’s Day. In addition, the council operates as the first in-line for assisting in staff events and functions. We support community-based philanthropic activities off-campus such as The Tiyya Foundation. Most notably, we created and implemented UCI’s first educational outreach program in the Social Sciences—GlobalConnect@UCI. Interested in representing our school? The Dean’s Ambassador Council will be accepting applications in Spring 2019. Copyright © 2019 Dean's Ambassadors Council. Powered by WordPress. Theme: Spacious by ThemeGrill.
