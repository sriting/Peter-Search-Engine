All questions should be directed to etrainer@cs.cmu.edu Printing and Displaying Your Poster Posters should use the International Standards Organization (ISO) 216 European A1 format in portrait orientation. The dimensions for A1 format are 594mm x 841mm, or 23.4” x 33.1”. The conference will provide easels, blank foam boards of size 24” x 35”, clips, and push pins. Presenters may bring their posters already printed on foam boards, or they can bring rolled up posters and use the clips or push pins to secure them to the conference-provided foam boards. Do not tape posters to the foam boards provided by the conference. Poster Design Tips The following tips may help you prepare a successful poster: • A poster should be self-explanatory for someone who just walks up to it and looks at it. • Readability is critical; use modest amount of text in a large, sans-serif font (e.g., Helvetica). - Titles and main headings should be no smaller than 72 pt. font. - All other text should be no smaller than 36 pt. font. • Figures, tables, and charts should be large enough to read easily. • Do not print and tape pages of the abstract or paper to the poster. • Simplify what you present; subtleties and complexities can be conveyed verbally. • Include a contact address (e.g., e-mail) so someone who is interested can follow up.
