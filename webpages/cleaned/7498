UCI System Test Laboratory TOPMARGIN=0 LEFTMARGIN=0> xxxxxx UC Irvine xxxxxx System Test Laboratory Testing Home Projects Publications Links About the Laboratory This lab is devoted to the study of testing problems in hardware and hardware/software systems. For large hardware and software design projects, it is typical that over 50% of design effort and cost is dedicated to testing and debugging. Our research includes testing for design errors and testing for physical defects occuring during the VLSI manufacturing process. The laboratory is directed by Prof. Ian G. Harris and research projects include Covalidation of Embedded Hardware-Software Systems, FPGA testing, Behavioral Design Validation, and Partial Scan/BIST Insertion. CS Home UCI Home
