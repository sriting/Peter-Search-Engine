   This sound like vtml, to a great extent. I'm not claiming that VTML is
the perfect solution, but a version that is less rigid on policy, and
better adapted to arbitrary data types seems that it meets the needs you
list.

Check. Again, we have to remove policy dependencies.

Is this why the update is multipart? so that several URLs can be updated in
a single operation?  This seems one way to get transactions.

This should be OK. We do need to make sure that servers can NOP whatever
doesn't apply to their policies harmlessly. We need lists of essential
operations from implementors of these various models.
