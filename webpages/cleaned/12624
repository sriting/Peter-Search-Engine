Office Hrs - Prof. Michael Dillencourt Office Hrs - Prof. Michael Dillencourt When to find me [Fall Quarter, 2018]. Office hour: 3:15 - 4 Friday, in DBH 4086. The CompSci 161 lecture ends at 2:50, and I will stay either inside or immediately outside the classroom as long as there are questions. I think a 25-minute buffer should be adequate, but if I am a few minutes late please be patient. 161 students: I am available after class to answer questions. 260 students: I am available after class on Monday and Wednesday. Where/How to find me: Office: DBH 4086 Mailing address: Michael B.
