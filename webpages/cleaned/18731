Norman Makoto Su | About Norman Makoto Su About Research Lab Teaching Personal Contact Room 201B Informatics West 919 E. 10th Street Bloomington, IN 47408 +1 (812) 855-1760 Interested in research? I’m always looking to do research with motivated undergrads and grad students. If you’re interested in technology and the people that use it, send me an email to schedule a meeting. I am an assistant professor in the School of Informatics, Computing, and Engineering, a faculty fellow of the Rob Kling Center for Social Informatics, and an affiliate faculty in Cognitive Science at Indiana University Bloomington. At IUB, I count myself lucky to be one of the troublemakers in the Human Computer Interaction Design (HCI/d) group. I am also an affiliated faculty member in the Institute of Software Research at the University of California, Irvine. Before, I did a postdoc at University College Dublin, and my PhD at the University of California, Irvine. I direct the Authentic User Experience Lab (AUX Lab) where we integrate empirical and humanistic methods in HCI to study and design with subcultures. By amplifying and predicting societal concerns and innovations, my research on subcultures envisions designs for members of marginalized and mainstream cultures. With my collaborators, I’ve studied a wide range of “users”, including corporate nomadic workers, knowledge management practitioners, hardcore video gamers, hunters, minimalists, and Irish traditional musicians. My academic interests lie in human–computer interaction (HCI), computer–supported cooperative work (CSCW), the humanities, ubiquitous computing, organizational/management science, and science & technology studies (STS).
