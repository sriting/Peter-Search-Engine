Interactive & Collaborative Technology Ubiquitous Computing The general track of the Informatics concentration covers aspects from both the ICT track and the to broadly cover the topics of Informatics. CURRENT DEGREE REQUIREMENTS Informatics is the interdisciplinary study of the design, application, use, and impact of information technology. It goes beyond technical design to focus on the relationship between information system design and use in real-world settings. These investigations lead to new forms of system architecture, new approaches to system design and development, new means of information system implementation and deployment, and new models of interaction between technology and social, cultural, and organizational settings. In the Bren School, Informatics is concerned with software architecture, software development, design and analysis, programming languages, ubiquitous computing, information retrieval and management, human-computer interaction, computer-supported cooperative work, and other topics that lie at the relationship between information technology design and use in social and organizational settings. Effective design requires an ability to analyze things from many different perspectives, including computer science, information science, organizational science, social science, and cognitive science. Relevant courses in those disciplines are therefore an integral part of the program and give this concentration a unique interdisciplinary flavor, which is imperative as the computing and information technology fields play such a pervasive role in our daily lives.
